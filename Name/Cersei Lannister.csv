2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,My husband.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And have you bled yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Stop. STOP.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Please.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,We have another wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Where is the beast?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Is this some trick?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How would you handle them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,A royal army?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How could you be so stupid?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And my husband?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Let me go.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if you find the proof?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,As was I.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,We still outnumber them.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Five.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What do you want?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Our marriage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Every day.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Do you know what your wife has done?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You were the King's Hand!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You shall now be held accountable.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I took you for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You're in pain.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Perhaps it's time to go home.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime would have killed him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Do you love your children?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,No more than I love mine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Thank the Gods.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Hated him? I worshiped him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Oh, but it was."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Robert, my sweet..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You think he stands alone?
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"You disappoint me, child."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,That depends.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,On your brother. And on you.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,Ser Barristan Selmy.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Rise, Ser Barristan."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?"
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Careful, Ser."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,cersei lannister,"Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cersei lannister,"My son, this is madness."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,cersei lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And are you not a Lord at my command?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our father is Hand of the King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I tried to stop it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What do you know about warfare?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,You are here to advise him.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,How?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,One.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And which truth is that?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What is all this?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,His life is in danger.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,If that's everything?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,He might.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Would you like that?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,She'll be a hostage.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Get out! Get out!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Killed? By whom?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,cersei lannister,"One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,In what way?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Wait until you birth a child.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You can try, little dove."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,More than we have.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Did you?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Odd little boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You and Varys both.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's only a boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's not ready.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because he doesn't have a cock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I'm happy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I have your little whore.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Get out.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Your words are always wise and measured.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You brought me something?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I know what ten drops will bring.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Sansa.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Oh. On all of us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even me?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,One for her.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Here. Sit. Drink.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Pretty.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,When did you leave Lorath?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Tell us a story, Shae."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What news?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back inside at once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back to his chambers now.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Now!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is my son?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Like stags.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And wolves.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Father.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,cersei lannister,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,It's your sister. The queen.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're meeting Father today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're going to make me cry.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I was nine, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,I'm sure she does.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Tell me what you think of her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,cersei lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Yes, it is."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I will not.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"No, I won't do it."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,We can have them both killed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,What do you want me to say?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Who's going to tell her?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Radiant? Why radiant?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Stay.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come along.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Leave.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,So she can have some happiness in her life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Elegant, I think."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Thank you for your help with the other matter.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Symptoms that are not your concern.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You jealous?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Yes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Not now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,For leaving me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,I'm saying you took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Come in.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You're an example to us all.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did you just bow?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you love him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She'll do no such thing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I suppose I am.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Small pleasures.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,No? How tolerant of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Help him! Someone help him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Don't touch him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,My son.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,You did this. You did this!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Take him! Take him!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is she?!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,It's not right. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Don't.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,She hoped or did you promise?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,And?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,There he is.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Long may he reign.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You still mourn for Joffrey?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He would have been your nightmare.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That seems reasonable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,A fortnight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,We had that in common.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then whom can we trust?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Haven't a clue.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That can't be.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,How much?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,May I show you the gardens?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"No, you couldn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I didn't realize you were a poet.

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Beautiful name.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, we can avenge them."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I know he did.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,A coward and a traitor.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Conquered with what?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,You seem to be in good form.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Does it matter?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Bloody Martells.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Not anymore.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,You can save him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Will it weaken him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Very well then.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm opening it again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I will not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'll tell everyone the truth.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Your legacy is a lie.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes you do.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Jaime.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,He's not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I choose you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I told him about us.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Go and ask him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I don't care.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Why not?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,He'll never know we've been gone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Of course we should.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,But I will be queen?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Will the king and I have children?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,That doesn't make sense.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will wait.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Thank you so much for your kind words.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Uncle, it's quite alright."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What can I do for you?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I don't know what you're talking about.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,There are only two like it in the world
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,What?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You never made anything better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You go there with an army, it's an act of war."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Not him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Take the head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Very good.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The king is very busy at this moment.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,That is not your concern as Master of War.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,I'll leave you to it then. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's no need for such formalities.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Won't that be a lovely day.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Remember. Anything you need.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You were assaulted?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why no shoes?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Perhaps they're right.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,How's your work coming along?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You've made progress?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,How much can the Crown afford?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,In person.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,Not small enough.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,Hmm.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,Did I arrest him?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,cersei lannister,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,That's not possible.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And if you succeed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,You must be exhausted.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Beg your pardon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Your happiness is all I want in this world
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Sleep well, sister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Who will stand judge?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Will you be one of them?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,What does The Mother's mercy entail?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I think I may have heard at one point.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I'm afraid i don't.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Move. Let me go immediately.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My son. Let me speak to--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My face will be the last thing you see before--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,The charges?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,All lies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,Tell him I need to speak to him.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can't stay here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Lancel Lannister.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I was lonely and afraid.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,May the gods forgive me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,No.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I do.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Trial? I have confessed?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Thank you. Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Am I free to go?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,My atonement?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,Myrcella…
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,"All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,"She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don't know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,"I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I'm not a monster"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,"No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they'd die “And gold their shrouds” Everything she said came true You couldn't have stopped it It's prophecy It's fate"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,"Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours That was a prophecy, too I didn't listen to you, and everything you said came true"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,Get out of my way
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,What are the king's orders?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,I would like to speak to my son
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,Good It was always her color
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,I understand I'm glad to see you
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,It's all right
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,cersei lannister,Always
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Varys's little birds
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Not yet
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Why are you here
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,enters the room
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Leave.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Is this a Small Council meeting?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"As have we all, unfortunately."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You've spoken with him?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,I agree.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"What, then?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,You can't.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Never. I'll never leave my son.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,The king is aware of their presence?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Get out.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,I choose violence.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,There's to be a royal announcement?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Why wasn't I informed?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,To stand by my son.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess. Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,You've always been quiet.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Shame.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Show me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Are you afraid of me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the east.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"A dynasty for us, then."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,There's nothing to say.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Not all of them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,A queen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,If not the most humble.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,What do you want in return?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I decline your proposal.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,when the war is won.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's the one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,How long does the poison take?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,But death is certain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,How many men did we lose?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,turns and walks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,After all this time it still amazes me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And you believed her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"looks away, then sits down."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,That won't be necessary.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,What did our brother have to say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,To discuss a surrender?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Are you going to punish him?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Bronn.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,You.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Never betray me again.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why isn't she with them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And the rest of them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Including our brother.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Where is she?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Didn't travel with you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,We've been here for some time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Sit down or leave.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then why are we here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What are you talking about?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"In return, the King"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,the destruction of this family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You killed our father
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I will not hear it, not from you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not hear it!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
