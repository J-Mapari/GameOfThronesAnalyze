2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,So what do you talk about?

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What did you say?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where are we?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Some climb straight up the ice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"It's just thunder, sweet giant."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You need to keep quiet.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,That's a horse dying.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,They're long gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,He'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Listen to me, little lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Shhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I learned to walk in darkness.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Say your good-byes, little man."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Keep this one safe. He means the world to me.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,A lord?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,The flayed man.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,You eat them after?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,Then I've seen worse.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,I can give you what you want.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,That so?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece."
