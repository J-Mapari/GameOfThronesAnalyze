2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,And how will she do that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,"Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.

2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty.

2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,Why?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,Give your uncle a kiss.

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Oh no!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,What a twat.

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."

2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,How?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,They were lesser men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
