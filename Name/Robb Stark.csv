2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,First we have to win the war.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He would have liked you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That would be a start.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How? How?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Tell me this isn't true.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,You betrayed me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Still no word?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I know that.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I love her.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,It is important to me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,"Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,A Mallister?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,"What's your name, friend?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Never?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,If you no longer believe-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,You don't think we can win?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,What value was the mill?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Is he there now? Of course not.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,How many men did you lose?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Bring them in.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,They were boys! Look at them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Leave him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Kneel, my lord."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You were right.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Who are you writing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Is that Valyrian?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Gaaa? Say hello for me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Ritsas.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I will.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"What, now? Are you certain?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Angry? You're my queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Maybe one of each.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,If Walder Frey cooperates.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Thank you, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Striking your king is an act of treason.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Boy or girl?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Mother.
