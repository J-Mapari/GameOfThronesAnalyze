2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do you want?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Let her go.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You were sent here to kill me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,So why haven't you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do your captains have to say about that?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Over what?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You're a strange man.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,And this is supposed to impress me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Will you fight for me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Swear to me.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,Where?

2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,You leave tonight.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,And Daario Naharis?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,What does it mean?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Fly.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Let me pass

2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.

2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever been to Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk without shoes?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Are they attacking?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,What is he doing?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Which is why you must remain by my side.

2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You sure you don't want a horse?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Horses are faster than men.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!

2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, that was it."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,I will answer injustice with justice.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Who told you to take the Navy?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,So why did you do it?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many ships?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many men can they carry?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I will do what queens do. I will rule.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,I thank him for his prayers.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Send the next one in.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,I thank you.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Then it is my honor to receive you.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Your father crucified innocent children.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what traditions do you speak of?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,How many more?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,212?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Don't do that again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Tell me why you're here.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You swore me your sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Do what you do best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Take off your clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You're here early.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You neither approve nor trust.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I trust you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You think he was spying on you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,But you are not Dothraki.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The...the pillar an the stones.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Haven't you ever wondered?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Why did the usurper pardon you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Why, then?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What was the content of these letters?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What information?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Yes or no?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Because you knew it was poisoned.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You betrayed me from the first.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,and you want me to forgive you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,You speak it very well.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,What is it that you want from me?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,Approach my friend.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,What was her name?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,How old was she?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Sons of the Harpy?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,They've never killed before.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Concessions?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,No fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,How many times must I say no before you understand?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,What?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Viserion? Rhaegal?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Easy. Easy. Easy.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,It would send a message.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Thank you all for your counsel.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,About what?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I'm not my father.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,The law is the law. Take him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Leave me.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Drogon...
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He sang to them?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He was good?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do with the money?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,How many others are there?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,I do not recognize this tradition.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Walk forward.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Another step.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,But she does not give up on them.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Are you jealous?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I do.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,So what else can I do?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,No. I can't
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Of course
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I think I've seen enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Get him out of my sight.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, many opportunities."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No. Not until forced to do so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should kill him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,It's probably my safest option.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And what would your father do?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Is that why you killed him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Which kind is that?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,But you trust him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The brother who killed my father.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to kill you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,How to get what I want.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The common people.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Where have you been?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,That is greatness?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If need be.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Someone else's reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Drogon!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Valahd..

2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,daenerys targaryen,Do not touch me
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,daenerys targaryen,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons"

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,No. I don't want either of those things.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends.

He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss?

2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,This is entirely different.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."

2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Will their ships be enough?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And that's all?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Reasonable.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,No more.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not coming with us.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I don't know. Maybe no one.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No one tells me to do anything.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Don't get angry.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No tears.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's not.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, you really are."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's your counsel I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,daenerys targaryen,Shall we begin?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could remember it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Not so many lions.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I never properly thanked you for that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who gave the order to kill me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who hired the assassins?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,To keep yourself alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,What does your Lord expect from me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"No, but I like it better."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You know him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,He sounds like quite a man.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Do I have your support?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Forgive me --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Then why are you here?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"But still, I need your help?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You told me you liked this man.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,The dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Is that another figure of speech?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,All of them?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Which wise man said this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,He is my Hand.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What happened?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Many things?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,It's all right.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,When?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,That's very good to hear.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Isn't it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks over to JON SNOW.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What do you think I should do?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I'm at war. I'm losing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins walking close to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Step forward, My Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not kneel?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm not beheading anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns back to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You're not sure how you feel about that?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,So it was a figure of speech?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,He is my friend.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You look strong. You found a cure?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,It would be my honor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,steps forward and hugs JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You said you don't have enough men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And how would you get into King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I haven't given you permission to leave.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,smiles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,But I've grown used to him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,You're not a hero.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,My apologies.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Yes. That's all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Just the King
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't have children.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,The witch who murdered my husband.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever they want.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,How many today?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They don't like the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you can.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,No one would find us.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So keep your queen warm.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Don't be afraid.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So you're the man?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there must be something I could give you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,For what crime?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,From the Citadel?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Not Randyll Tarly?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your brother stood with your father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Of course.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister pledged to send her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Like you knew your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Not for the first time.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Have you done something to offend me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Long ago and long forgiven.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought he knew his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ours certainly have been.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That bothers you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"All my life, I've known one goal"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Someone taller.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I take the Iron Throne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,But why aren't you with her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who's that?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That's impossible.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who told you this?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He saw it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,The dead are already here.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Go!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Jorah!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,Gendry.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"That's right, isn't it?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,You're Robert Baratheon's son.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,Does anyone?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,See? You're not the only one who's clever.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,And Varys?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"All right, then."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Let it be fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
