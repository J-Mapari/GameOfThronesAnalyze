2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?

2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,She was very kind.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It was always my color.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"And you, Stark."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Why do you read so much?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Is this a trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."

2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,You're leaving?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,What kind of reports?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,But I'm better than every...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,He'll never walk again.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I've had worse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,The Wall's no place for cowards.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,You're not. You're freezing.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"Yes, he is."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Well… You can't get any worse.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,He wasn't hungry.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,No one touches Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I know where to put it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I build my own fires.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Why is he alone?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,jon snow,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"

2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.

2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,He's not a pet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Ghost is different.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We could do the same.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,My father always said I'm of the North.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I wasn't joking.

2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,What's your name?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm Jon Snow.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"No. No, I'll do it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm as much a crow as they are.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'll find them.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,There's no shelter anywhere.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,No fire.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Yes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop moving.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop it!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,You're still moving.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Let's move.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Don't call them that.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Neither. Both.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Move!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,No.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Never. We swore an oath.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Would you please shut up?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,You're a free woman?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,It was my choice to say the words.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Of course I like girls.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Walk.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I know how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,We're close.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Nothing happened between you and me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Turn back around.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"What, right here in the muck?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Enough!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,The others?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They died because of me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They'll never trust me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jon snow,Careful with that. You might cut yourself.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jon snow,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jon snow,Stop!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Mance was a ranger.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,What happened to their fathers?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,He wants me to lead one day.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I want to be free.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Relax your bow arm.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,I understand.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,You want to protect your people.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,What's wrong with him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,It's only horses. No men.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,About three hundred.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,Do you think anyone got away?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Three.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Castle Black.

2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand men.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't need you to protect me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Give it back.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,We shouldn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,You seemed to like it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,There's been no one else. Only you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Who was he?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You ever climbed it before?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Aren't you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You kill someone for them?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Can we not talk about that here?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Did I seem scared the other day?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Only in the beginning.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,What secret?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,I won't.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Take my hand!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"About a week, I think."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Most of the time, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,They help the men march.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You're gonna scare it off.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's too far away.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's a windmill.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Just the men who used to live here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Fainting.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Well not all girls are like you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,So I could tear it off you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Yes, first we'll live."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,He breeds them for the Watch.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch protects him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,Ygritte!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,You were right the whole time.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I do know some things. I know I love you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,Pyp? Sam?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I've done plenty wrong.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I didn't murder him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He wanted me to kill him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I do.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,Help him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,And the mutineers stayed?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,We need to ride north and kill them all.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Bring it through! And again.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Very nice. Good.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Let's see what you can do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Olly, you just watch for now."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Grenn and I were helping them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Someone has to train them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You fight well.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,She wasn't safe here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Castle Black could be next.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Ahem, brothers."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, brothers."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,How many?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Why?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,We lost four brothers?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,I count ten dead mutineers.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Where in seven hells? Come here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,"I missed you, boy."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Greetings.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Come on, Ghost."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We need to prepare.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We wouldn't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,They won't stop them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The stewards.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The builders.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,You couldn't have known.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,She...she had red hair.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Well what do you want me to say?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,So you and Gilly never-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,There will.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Yes sir.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We can't just let them attack the gate!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,They won't summit before dawn.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Because I've made that claim.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Knock! Draw! Loose!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Now!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Oil!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What are you doing up here?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Two brothers now fight with me.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,to Sam* I don't want you out there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I need him more than I need you.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"No, shh, don't talk."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We'll go back there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Aye, you shouldo ve."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,For one night.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I'm going to find Mance.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I'm going to try.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Yes.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She's dead.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,No.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Ygritte.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,That's not wine.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn came from a farm.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn and Mag.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Turn your army around and go home.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"He was, your grace."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,No one's going to torture you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I suppose Stannis does.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I don't have a king.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Say farewell.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She told you?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Get your shield up.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You're not cold, my lady?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Roose Bolton.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They're good men.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,It's where she belonged.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I don't think that's likely.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I respect him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Your grace…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,How much time do I have?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Here we are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You know what Stannis wants?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Shouldn't a king be bold?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Then bend the knee and save your people.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They'll burn you alive.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,No. Only one of their own.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,The Lord Commander's niece.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,Most likely.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Unpleasant, I expect."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,I'm going to refuse him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Your Grace.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I can imagine no higher praise.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And the wildlings?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,As long as he's ruling them.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And what needs to be done?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Sam. . Maester Aemon?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Are you refusing to obey my order?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Take Lord Janos outside.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly, bring me my sword."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Good.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Never even heard of these people.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Not him.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,He murdered my brother.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,How can I help you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I can't.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I know. But I still love her.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Maester Aemon.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,How are you feeling?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,But you don't know what it is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What about you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What if I unchained you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,And we've slaughtered theirs.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It's not a trick.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"As always, thank you for your honesty."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"Thank you, Sam."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,Me too.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Does that make me a fool?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He's not my prisoner.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're allies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,No. But I trust the man.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He died.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,I put an arrow through his heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,How many are with us? 5000?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're leaving too many behind.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,And he knew them better than I ever will.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get in line! Get in line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Hold the line! Hold the line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Now!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You should be on one of those boats.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You have my word. I've given orders.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,The Dragonglass!

2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Let's go now! Now!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,It was a failure.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,"I went to save them, I failed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--

2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,To your return.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,It's not their fight!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Stannis?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,He could be lying.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Where is he?

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,"If you have any last words, now is the time"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,Neither was killing me
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,"I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,How could we know?

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW looks at SANSA.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back.

You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,It's just more of the same.

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW nods.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."

2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Are you sure they'll come?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lady Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,62?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,House Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lord Glover.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,There's no time.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We fight with the army we have.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You don't have to be here.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,A pincer move.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, for what they're worth."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,He's overconfident.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We can't give up on our brother.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, that's good advice."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Any advice?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,How do you know what he commands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Why?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,What kind of god would do something like that?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Get word --
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,What is that?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm not a Stark.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,And you trust him?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Not just the boys.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,But if we're going to survive this winter together...
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Ned Umber.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Alys Karstark.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Stand.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Of course you can, but--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,At what?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,You almost sound as if you admire her.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Read the last bit.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,But?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Come in.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I know that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I'm leaving both in good hands.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,You don't belong down here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I have nothing to say to you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Of course.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I didn't ask --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She's starting to let on.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,True. But I'm not a Stark.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,They're hard to miss.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,we're finished.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,And why would I do that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Am I your prisoner?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You probably don't believe me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,What do you mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Amazing thing to see.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,He enjoys talking.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I never expected that you would.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I haven't either.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Your Grace.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The Children of the Forest made these.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,A very long time ago.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,No.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"No, I don't think I can."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I would never presume to --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,glances back towards the dragons.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Who?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I think she has a good heart.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,It doesn't matter.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Of course.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Why did you leave your homeland?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm sorry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,You believe that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,releases THEON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The queen is gone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You weren't gone long.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and doesn't say anything.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"No, I'm not."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Thousands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I served with your father. He was a great man.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,interrupts VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I need to go home.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,They won't have to.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You survived King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Your Grace, this is --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks to DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're a lot leaner.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I grew up on stories about them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Do you know how to use one?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Well, that's a problem."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,nods.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We could use the help.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Heave!
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Two.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Both.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks around the table.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Not enough.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,He's right. We're all on the same side.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We're all breathing.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Are you all right?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Ever been north before?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You've never been down south.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,That's the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I heard.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm not his son.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Who's that?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You knew him?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I serve the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Why?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,So what are you fighting for?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But we all die.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,How many people live here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We can destroy them by burning them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I know!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I did this. I should go.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No one is less happy about this than I am.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Who told you that?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, what now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,All right.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No. Not compared to you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Our father was more of a father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Look at you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You're a man.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where's Arya?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's not important.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,How did you sneak up on me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You still have it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Have you ever used it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Jealous?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Now you're defending her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's the matter?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong with them?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What if he doesn't want me to?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What do I hold onto?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We'd be pretty old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I told you we needed allies.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Do you have any faith in me at all?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Were you hiding from me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Little Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Know what?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I wasn't a king.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you talking about?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Daenerys is our queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,That's treason.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We need every man we can get.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I thought we'd lost you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How did you find each other?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Umbers?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How long do we have?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,They're coming.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,But there are too many of them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Far too many.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Our enemy doesn't tire.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Let's get some rest.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Your Grace.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,No.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Gilly? Little Sam?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,If you want to join them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,To protect them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Now it's just us three.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,He didn't. He loved her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I wish it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Bran. He saw it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,The Night King is coming.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,Dany!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,Get off!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,Bran!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,jon snow,We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She shouldn't be alone.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Aren't you worried for her?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,What do you want?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,I don't want it. I never have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She is my queen.
