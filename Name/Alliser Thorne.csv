2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,Next!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,Tell them your name.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
