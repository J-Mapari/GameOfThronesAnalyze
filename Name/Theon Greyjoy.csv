2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We have visitors.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Important enough for the likes of you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Hmm?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm talking about justice.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I don't know. It's not my House.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,And you can afford that?

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Let me see it one more time?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,Lord.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I will be lord after my father.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,theon greyjoy,Lord Frey controls that bridge.

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Looks smaller.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I don't blame him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I haven't paid you.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,None like you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Yara?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You're a woman!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What are you doing here?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You lying bitch.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,We do not sow.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You gave me away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I have no other family.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I would.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I've taken your castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,To take the castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Find the halfwit.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you will."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,They are not my people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
