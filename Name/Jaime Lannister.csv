2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"

2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."

2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of‚Äù?"

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,It's the truth.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Of course it bothers me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‚Äòboy'? Insulted?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.

2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You didn't, though."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."

2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know.

2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll only have to do one thing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll have to die.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Damn.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Untie me. Now!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,For stealing a pig?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Have you been to Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Then you don't know me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Is it near Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I've never been there.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Those were Stark men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,So how shall we pass the time?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,All the good it's done her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Oh, gods, you did."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"No, you really can't."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He knows who I am.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I need to rest.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,You were not beating me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You know who she is, don't you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Not defiled.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I'm famished, actually."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Well, I do like partridge."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,My father-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Don't.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"If I die, you won't be getting-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Is there word from the capital?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Will I die?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,No milk of the poppy.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream loudly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Now get out.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I trust you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,He'll make time for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,Shall we drink on it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,I'm afraid I must insist.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Tomorrow.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I owe you a debt.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What is?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You performed experiments on living men.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,With their permission?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Countless has a nice ring to it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A fair offer.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Why not?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,They'd be fools to kill her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We have to return to Harrenhal.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I've left something behind.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,And what are those orders?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You think you'll get a reward.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Whoa.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Be quiet.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A wooden sword?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You gave her a wooden sword.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Get behind me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Pull her up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jaime lannister,Cersei.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Magnificent.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Looks fresh-forged.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Two?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Home?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's my answer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Supper would be nice.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I suppose you want the sword back.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Days?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Uh... a hook would be more practical.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Odd little man.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What symptoms?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You let him touch you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You drink more than you used to.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,It must have been traumatic for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,A rather short siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Father disowned me today.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You're forgetting Tyrion.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Something's changed.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to apologize for?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I... What are you saying?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Go away.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,So they say.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's still time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Yes, there she is."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Gilded steel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Oh!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"No, I'll do it. Leave us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I can't fight anymore.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Is this place safe?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Uh-huh.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Come on, then."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Move away!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,How are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't know what I saw.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't care.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What the hell was that?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You talk to my brother this way?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Do you think he did it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,We're done for today.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Don't. You know what's coming?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Depends. Did you do it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know I can't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Mmm. It's yours.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I hope I got your measurements right.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Of course you do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Good-bye, Brienne."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father's orders.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You'd condemn your own son to death?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You've always hated Tyrion.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Justice?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,He'll be executed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You're going to be found guilty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Do you trust me?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,You fell in love with a whore.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,It is tempting.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,If he wins.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,No. Not Ser Meryn.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Soon.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I've never seen him fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Oberyn believes in himself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Beheading.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Cousins.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"The joke wore thin, though."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I had other interests.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,He was twice your size.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Good luck today.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Tyrion is your family.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You don't get to choose.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Those are words.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Told him what?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You told him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You think he'll just accept that?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,What did you say?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Someone will walk in.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,What do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Varys.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You have more friends than you thought.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"Farewell, little brother."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Quickly now.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,This is exactly what they want.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,A summons from the queen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,It's a threat.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No note.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Softer.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Not so loud.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,The world can't know knows she's our daughter.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'll make things better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm not going to ask him anything.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I would have advised against that.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,As far south as south goes.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Is that Estermont?

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,You should be happy to go back. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,That's why you're here.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Because I don't want to start a war.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,It has to be me.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Varys set him free.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Sounds like all the rest.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,In the arms of the woman I love.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Let's go.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Pentoshi.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,As I said. Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,A bag of gold.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,It was a heavy bag.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Four.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"One, if he's slow."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I thought the sharks would get us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Luck.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,First we need to bury these bodies.

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"Alright, thats enough."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,It can wait. Up there.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,That's the Water Gardens.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,I like to improvise.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Myrcella.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,And more hands. How's Trystane?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I don't understand.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Doran.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Princess Myrcella.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,What a lovely dress.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You must be cold.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I'm afraid he does.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I accept.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You're a good man.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,There was one condition.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,She will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Of course, she's my niece."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,"Whenever you're ready, My Lord."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Try not to lose it this time.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so‚Ä¶ so well arranged.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is‚Ä¶ we don't choose whom we love. We just‚Ä¶ It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say‚Ä¶
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,No. I'm afraid you don't.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother‚Äôs Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jaime lannister,Mother
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jaime lannister,"Shh, shh Don't think about it"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jaime lannister,She's not suffering She's gone No one can hurt her anymore

2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jaime lannister,You don't believe that
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Almost
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Your mother wouldn't do that
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Are you angry with her?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Then why didn't you let her come? She has every right to be here
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,"They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while I'm here Why haven't you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Why not?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,We all fail sometimes
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,"Go and see your mother, Tommen"

2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,You must long for the next life
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,You imprisoned and humiliated my sister
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,What about my sins?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,"I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve?"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,"Oh, the gods won't mind They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,They should be closer if you mean for them to save you
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,jaime lannister,I've fought against worse odds
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,My lord.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Someone certainly does.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Lothar, is it?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,He's an old man.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Blackfish.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I don't have them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Well, now you have."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You're welcome to have him.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Exactly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,We shouldn't argue about politics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,What do you propose?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,He's even more stubborn than you are.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You have my word. You have until nightfall.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,It's yours. It will always be yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Of course it does.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Lord Edmure.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll talk about whomever I want.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Good. Bring him to me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,You're welcome to her.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Those two have their eyes on you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Not my type.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,There you go.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,I'm sure he would be.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"No, but back in your day."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Come on.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,What is this?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"No, not angry."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Should I be?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Dragonstone.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,We never talked about Tommen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Our baby boy killed himself.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Cersei--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Well, it looks like all of them."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Lord Tarley.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"Rickon, isn't it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,That's it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,Advice?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,No.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,Don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,It is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,Widow's Wail.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,"Yes, it has."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,I think we're done here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen‚Äôs Justice,jaime lannister,No. I made sure of that.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Halt that wagon!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,You don't want Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Stranger things have happened.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,The current harvest?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Good.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We are stretched a bit thin.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Rickon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,And?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over at BRONN
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'm not abandoning my army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We can hold them off.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Hold the line!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Archers! Archers with me!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Knock!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Loose!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I can't shoot with one hand.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Come on!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Take cover!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Come on, boy. Come on!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You could have killed me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Ending the war by killing her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't you mean we're fucked?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I have to tell Cersei.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We haven't done a full counting.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,He didn't.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,After.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why down here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,remains silent and stares at TYRION.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't talk about our father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,What do you want?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why was QYBURN here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I met with Tyrion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,To discuss an armistice.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,looks confused.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You let it happen. Why?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Who will you say is the father?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,People won't like that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The thrill will fade.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Gold?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,How many?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Fuck loyalty?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And tell her what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Your Grace.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Preparing the expedition north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I made a promise.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And then what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Two.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I didn't conspire with him.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Treason?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Give the order, then."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I don't believe you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She did.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,This is about survival.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm not that person anymore.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not angry at me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Why didn't you tell them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What about afterwards?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,How do they feel about their new queen?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,And she is? Different?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're sure about her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She didn't seem sure about you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Hmm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"No, that part is real."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Your cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Lady Brienne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,He's come a long way.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, I think you're right."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I truly don't.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You want me to insult you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"So, what can we do?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,That would be something to see.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Mm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you miss it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Oh! My lady.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure someone does.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'll prove it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,We'd better get some rest.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,They're coming! Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,"Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Get in there!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Relieve the archers!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Archers on top!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Draw!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Look out!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,jaime lannister,"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You've underestimated her before.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Difficult to do from here.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,I'll try.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You would have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Soldier!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Well, maybe for you."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You're no king.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,It doesn't matter.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,This way.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,It's all right.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Just look- Look at me. Look at me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
