2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I gave you my name.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You ought to burn them you killed.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,The Free Folk.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Will you burn me? After?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Go on. Be quick about it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Do it. Bastard, do it!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You can't do it. We both know it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Here? There's no shelter here.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,But a fire is-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Have it your way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they're out looking for you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they'll find you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, stones? Or bone?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So the lads just do it with each other?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Never?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So you don't like girls?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,But you chose never to touch them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So why are you fighting us?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I could teach you how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,How long till we get back to your crows?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I'll keep you warm enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Are you that afraid of it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It's nice and wet and warm.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It don't have teeth.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"All right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Should have took me while you had the chance.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ygritte,"We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ygritte,You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ygritte,"Come along, Jon Snow."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ygritte,Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,You're wearing the wrong color.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Sure, you will."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ygritte,"What, you've never met a warg?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ygritte,You said there was dead crows.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,He's no crow.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not afraid of you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,All of me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,We should.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Hmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,A maid. You were a maid.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,What do you think?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not done with you yet.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,How long's it been since you had a bath?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You were trembling like a leaf.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You all right?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How far are we?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You think? You don't know?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How do the men holding the banners fight?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,So what good are they?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"What, you're jealous?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Don't touch me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Is that a palace?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's swooning?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's fainting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Would you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You know nothing-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And how do you know that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Mance is different.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You don't know that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,All of us.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,How's he keep folks from stealing them?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,Do it. Do it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,No!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"Yeah, well, he's a liar."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I did.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I'm not anybody's.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Yes.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I probably killed him already.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
