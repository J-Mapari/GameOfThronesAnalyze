2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.

2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Does it give you joy to scare people?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,It was his duty. He never liked it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Why are you always so hateful?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"No, no!"

2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I thought it would be less messy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,His Grace was not with you?

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Just as I pray for the king's.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Will you slay him yourself?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I doubt it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Why would she be jealous?

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What's he doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,But we have guards to defend us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You said he was here to protect us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,My queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Praying.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey is my-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,And if the city should fall?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You were Robert's queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Come with me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What are you doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Where?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What about the king?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You won't hurt me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sansa stark,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Don't ruin the game.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,What about that one there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Lord Baelish.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,I won't tell anyone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's too old.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Send him in.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Ser Loras.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"I-, I-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,My father always told the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's a monster.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,What is?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Is it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Many ladies wear it this way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,You still want me to come with you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"I do, Lord Baelish."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Petyr.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,That's a wonderful pin.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I'm very happy about
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Do you think people will like it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Will they let me invite my family?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,But do you think they will?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"It's all right, really."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,No.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's tried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a Lannister.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"You look very handsome, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,When I have to.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,Fourteen.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,But your father-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What if I never want you to?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,A list of people you mean to kill?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,You should learn to ignore them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,So how should we punish them?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,I hear that you're a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,That's the vulgar word for dung.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,"Well, you asked me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"No, thank you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't need to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,How can you help me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,You're drunk.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Anyone would have done the same.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,sansa stark,We have a new queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,sansa stark,Can we leave now?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Where are we going?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Lord Baelish?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,I didn't murder anyone.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Why did you kill him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He saved me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He was helping me because I saved his life.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,We're all liars here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Where are you taking me?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Did you kill Joffrey?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I know it was you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,No.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I just do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,And what do you want?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Who could trust you?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,But how would they know?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Of course. I understand.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,I would never say a thing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"They did, and my father's."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Make him fly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No. We never...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Thank you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Really?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Yes. I'm very lucky.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"No, never."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Nothing. I'm a virgin.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,You're hurting me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Hello, Robin."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,It's a long story.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Yes, you certainly are."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,We don't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I like the sound of that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,All right.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You're being stupid.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I hit him.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I shouldn't have done that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Lord Baelish...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I didn't. You don't understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,He kissed me. I pulled away.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Please!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,He can stay.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Yes?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Neither do I.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,I know what you want.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Shall we go?

2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You don't know him.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think that's obvious?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,It's not enough!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Where is he?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,They were. Now they're starving.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,You are to me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,He did.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was a stupid girl.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,What do you want?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,It's a pretty picture.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,And then they broke faith.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Will you start wearing a crown?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're good at this, you know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,At ruling.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Why are you laughing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,He never said that to me.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I'm not trying to undermine you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Would that be so terrible?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,What does she want?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I learned a great deal from her.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I know exactly what he wants.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Whose?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How much do we have?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What does that mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,So they should be.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I wish Jon was here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I don't know what that means.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Try, please, for me."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How do you know all of this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Bran --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sighs.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,hesitates for a moment.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,smirks at ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,I wish I had.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"No, they're not."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"Arya, Bran's home too."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Bran has visions.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would you go back there?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Who else is on your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's declared for House Stark.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would he give you a dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,The cutthroat after your fall?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Don't do that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns around to face ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Say what you mean.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Are you angry with me?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I have work to do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns and walks away from ARYA.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,turns to look at ARYA.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They forced me to do it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You were there?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,But you didn't. Just like me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You never would have survived what I survived.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Arya --
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You think he wants to marry her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Lady
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Have my sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."

2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"

2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You want us to use you as bait?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,I'm not abandoning my people.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,I don't know how to use it.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,You were the best of them.

2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Uncle? Please sit.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
