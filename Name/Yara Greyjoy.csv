2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Is that an offer from my future king?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You're the one in skirts.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"

2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Be careful of their nets.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Stop. We yield.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Congratulations on your first command.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You are weak. And you're stupid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Go on, then. Warn me."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Leave us.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Shut up. What did you bring?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,He's your son.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,yara greyjoy,"I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,yara greyjoy,"They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you."

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,yara greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,yara greyjoy,I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.

2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down.

2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."

2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it.

2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,You and I have that in common.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,That's our way of life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,No more.

2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,I thought it wasn't for you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He's not your servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Once I kill my uncle.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He might have to intervene.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Until they've made their intentions known.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Stay here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Euron.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Are we in King's Landing?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You picked the losing side.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,We can take our home back.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,But kill the bastards anyway.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,"She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
