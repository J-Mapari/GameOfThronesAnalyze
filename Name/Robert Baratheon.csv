2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Cat!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ned.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,She belonged with me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Not all of them.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,So be it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,As you will.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Who was it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,How'd you do it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What do you mean it's empty?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Your outlaw... Any last words?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long before he figures it out?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,The whore is pregnant.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,She dies.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long can hate hold a thing together?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,So why now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I know.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Who'd have thought she had it in her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Hold your tongue.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, what was I saying?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Those were the days!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Out, all of you!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,Give it to the council after I'm dead.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,My memory.
