2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,It's a hard fall down these steps.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Cats? Syrio says…
