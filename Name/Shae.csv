2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Yes. And you're his...?

2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Love is not the thing he wants.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,My lion.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.

2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I don't know her name.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,How do you know her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,She's a whore.

2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,And was she good? Did you like her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,We have to protect her.

2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Now do you think I'm cruel?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I don't think they will even notice it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I'm sure he does.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,They haven't asked my opinion.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Chains?

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,I'm not your lady.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,"I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
