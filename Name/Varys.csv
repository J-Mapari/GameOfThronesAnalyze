2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lord Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lady Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I must admit I do not.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,Dreadful.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,But his mind is sound?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I didn't trust you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Someone who could afford it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He started asking questions.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,This Hand is not the other.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,We all have our qualities.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Strictly speaking.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Eyes I own.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Oh.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Have you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Was that you under the bed?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, please."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"You've seen better days, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"Oh, you can do better than that."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Serving a new King.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,My king.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,My lord.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How can you tell?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Who threatened you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Trouble with the wildlings?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How do you kill a dead man?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,We don't have that many books.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,What do we have?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,I am trying.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"I wish we could, too."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,A most highborn plumber.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,And you play it well.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Do you trust him?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Good.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,The map you asked for.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"No need for that, my dear."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I'm not like most men.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I thought you said you knew who I was.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Why would I lie about it?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Come along now, Podrick."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"We are trying, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, always in confidence."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,End your life?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Proof? Will there be a trial?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,You do not possess at the moment.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Is he very large?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Extraordinary.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What did he do to them?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,So what did they say?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What makes you say so?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,How do you know?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,When did you come to this strange country?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You were only a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"No, I expect not."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Ahem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,varys,Your Grace.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Prince Oberyn.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,May I ask why?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Most of us aren't princes.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,It's a long story.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,People I trust.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Nothing.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,varys,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Apologies.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,My lord?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Imp, half-man."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Your brother asked me to.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I never said you were perfect.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You don't like it?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,The road to Meereen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,I told you. A ruler.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Still, a man of talent."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,No.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Volantis is a large city.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,It's a perfectly good face.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,We should keep moving.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Where're you going?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"Oh, I know."
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,You walk like a rich person
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,She thinks you want to eat her baby
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,"His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,Mhysa means mother in Valyrian
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,Who wrote it?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,The Sons of the Harpy?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,She did fly away on a dragon and not come back
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,"The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,varys,"My little birds have already taken wing Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,varys,I do not make dwarf jokes
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,varys,"So, the fleet It's been burned"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,varys,Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,varys,"The Masters have retaken both cities Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,varys,Do they know that?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I don't know how you stand it in all that leather
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,If we could have the room
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I am not a torturer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though it so often is what people deserve
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,For now is the best we get in our profession.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,Would you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,You made a pact with fanatics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I know.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,varys,Fire and blood.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I did.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,Which you turned to your advantage.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,King Robert.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I swear it, my queen."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Why?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,So where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,My Lady --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Jon Snow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Nothing good.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,The Karstarks.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,Nothing lasts.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,varys,At least we're already in a crypt.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,varys,And got your face cut in half.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Come in.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,And?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Nothing?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We'll try again at supper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Who?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Of course they are. That's their job.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"What have I told you, Martha?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,The Northern armies?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We both know what she's about to do.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
