2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
