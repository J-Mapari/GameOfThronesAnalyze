2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay bolton,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Keep quiet.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,You're sure?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,"Come, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Sorry. Were you sleeping?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Please is not a body part.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Too vague.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Terrible guess.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now, where?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You're right.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Yes. You win.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I'm afraid I am.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Everything I told you is a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I win.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,But I was getting jealous.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,But my father taught me to aim for their head.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Sorry, what?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,A little louder.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You're no good to me dead. We need you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Stinking meat.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What is your name?!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,There you are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Not so pretty now.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father. Welcome home.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"A pleasure, Mother."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Give him the razor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,And crisped them so no one would know.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,This is turning into a lovely evening.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,how fast can you run?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,I have a treat for you. A reward.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"The britches, too, Reek. Take them off."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Do you love me, Reek?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,Theon Greyjoy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,And what are you really?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Until when?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,I believe we will. To our new home.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moors, fields, hills."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Tell me what you see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Nothing.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Ramsay Snow.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. ."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come back here. Myranda.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Do you have something to tell me?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Reek.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Who?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,She saw you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Give me your hand.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I forgive you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Allow me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"That's his new name, Reek."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Sorry about what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Wonderful. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,How can you be sure?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,So how did you manage it?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Getting her pregnant.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And if it's a boy?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Yes.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Are you pleased my lady?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,You're not lying to me?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Good. Now take off your clothes.
