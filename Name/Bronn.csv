2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,This sounds like a boring game.

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're sleeping through the war.

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Yeah, good."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bronn,Can't imagine why.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Boys?

2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,It will be my pleasure.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,He's talking about you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,You don't need to convince me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,To do what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,This is a shit idea.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I like to keep me hands clean.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,And one of these explains how to beat him?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We could throw books at his men.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"We don't have that many men, either."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,To the boys!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Drunk Lannisters.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Thank you very much.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I don't think he likes me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I know it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,And quicker. Eh?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Aye I expect he will someday.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,The ships are in the bay.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't get killed.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Oh, are we friends now?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Enhances it, really."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Been spending time with fancy folks.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,What if you took off that bit there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I didn't hear that.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"I will murder you, boy."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Pod.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I've been doing that for a while now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I grow poor protecting you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Briefly.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Which means you can afford it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Pace yourself, lad."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's stealing it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What's wrong with that?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,And what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,But what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,The lado s practically skipping.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What did you tell them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,She's a foot taller than you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,What's the youngest you've ever had?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,How much older?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Oh.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Yellow balls?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,I need a sigil.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Best time to attack a man.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Plan on growing it back?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,All taken care of.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Aye, she's on it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,All the time. He got used to it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bronn,Jon! Jon!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lord.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I've been a bit busy.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."

2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,We had some good days together.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What will you do?

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Oh.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Jaime fucking Lannister.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Ser Jaime.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Return from where?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,You ever been to Dorne?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Your niece?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Breakfast.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That would have been a shit way to die.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you count?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you think you can take?

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Dolphins maybe.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That one should be slow enough.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Nice move! .

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Birds have to eat too.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Well, she's made herself at home."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,Let's not do something stupid.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,That was something stupid.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I wouldn't say you beat me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,It's nothing. It's the dry air.

2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,bronn,Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.

2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,A parley or a fight?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.

2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You think they're fucking?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You must have shown it to her by now.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Is she? Oh.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Show me your stance.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"

2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Not blonde enough?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Maybe I'm not in the mood.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Fuck it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is no more High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is still the question of my prize.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,It's not a castle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,How about that one? It's available.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I beg to differ.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Right. Just not to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Like what?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on. Your father's not here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Listen.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,In line now!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Get back to King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Go get it then.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Where are you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on you fucker.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,What the fuck were you doing back there?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You saw the dragon between you and her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,looks incredulously at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You're fucked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,pauses and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,Best well jump back in that river.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And here I am ready to train.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I'll leave you to it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Oil?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,How many barrels?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Get 500 more.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yet, your brother--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I'm sure your new queen--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yeah, you, too."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Nearly killed it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,You're kidding me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Which girl?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,That fucking family.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The farther away, the better."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"In full, my lord Hand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Indeed we can.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,You Master of Grammar now too?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,The strong live and the weak don't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
