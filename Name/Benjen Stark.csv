2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Welcome.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,The kind I don't want to believe.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,Call me what you like.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
