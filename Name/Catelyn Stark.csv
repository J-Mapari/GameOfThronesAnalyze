2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I wish I could see the girls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Just for a moment.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?

I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
