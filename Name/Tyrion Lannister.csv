2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I did hear something about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,And the other brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Clever girl.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Have you?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Close the door!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Do you understand?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Beloved siblings.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Apparently not.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,A charming man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Good news or bad?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,You're joking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Curious.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,I like you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,How would you like to be rich?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,About the gold -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Confessing my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,I understand the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Agreed.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,"And feed it to the goats, yes."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,Uncle. Father.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,Sorry to disappoint you.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,"My sister rules, you mean."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tyrion lannister,Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Shagga likes axes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Took her? From whom?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What sort of accent is that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,For-
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Let's play a new game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Are you sure –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,That's not how the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did you hear that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What is it? What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Get my squire!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'll know.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Stay low?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,To battle!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'm alive?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Did we win?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where was he?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And where are they?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,And do what?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,So it would seem.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"l believe he used the word ""whore""."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Beloved nephew.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Of course you are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,One?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"A bit corpsey, yes."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,I thought you wanted to come here.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You can smell cum from the balcony?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,And so did the country.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You brought this on yourself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Do you understand we're losing the war?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,It was quite a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I don't like threats.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Safe travels, cousin."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Apparently you burn him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Wars have been started for less.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, we shan't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,To the new Commander.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,She was my mother too.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Keep your voice down.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Again, only temporary."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Kitchen wench.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but-"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Please.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Precisely.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Who better?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,A guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You cannot stop it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Find him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, you don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Well, make do."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't like his beard.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So you poisoned him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,For your trouble.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"No, I think not."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,When did she tell you this?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Swear to me on what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But I don't care about your life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,What? Demon monkey?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Demon monkey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My companion takes issue.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,How much do you have?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Move. Move!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Where's Sansa?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"I can, I am."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Well done, Clegane."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Since when do you light your own candles?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I thought the girls might help him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. If we can't control him
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Sins?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Do you have to do that here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Stannis will be here any day.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,For questioning?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We talked about this.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Pig shit.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Thank you, Podrick."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Neither do you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,It's not that little.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And why are you happy?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I thought you preferred blondes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Why do you care who I fuck?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Where did you find her?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I promise I will free you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Never.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Shae!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're beautiful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We have to be more careful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,There are people who want to hurt me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Promise me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Imagine Stannis' terror.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What do you want? Tell me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I do. Last thing I expected.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We should sail there immediately.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One game at a time, my friend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,A wedding.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oddly enough, I do."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm not."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,What of it?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't believe you have."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,They must be far enough in-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Nor you, my friend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Will you?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Stay safe, my lady."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,On the way.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Archers to their marks.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Hold fast.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Rain fire on them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh, fuck me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Pod.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,What happened?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Where am I?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Why should I believe you?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,To create strife between my sister and me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Then my hill tribesmen.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,It was good of you to come.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"Believe me, you don't."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Well?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Leave?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,What would we do in Pentos?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,I want to go with you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Pod?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,What are they doing here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think so."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,They stay outside.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How do you know that?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why do you care what I want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Slandered? When?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It's not slander if it's true.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Any lies in particular?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Still makes me more clever than you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Do you grow bored protecting me?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I thought we were friends.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How much?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Double?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It is mine by right.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Hmm, yes."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Master of Coin?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Not for bastards.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We don't. I did fuck her once.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,But we don't.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Good point.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You think all reading is dull reading.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Podrick.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Be back in time for my supper.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,No.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, you have to."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,What did you do to them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,And they seemed to like these things?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Only they weren't paid.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Is that what you're telling us?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Sit down, Podrick."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We're going to need details. Copious details.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I need to know.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I don't know. Do I?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,The sorcerer.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I understand that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I would.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,My lady-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Quite sufficient. Thank you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Give me that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,What's she doing here?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't my best, but-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And how do we do that?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Wonderful.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,You can't mean it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,She's a child!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And if I refuse?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,On a boat you built.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Alone, if I may."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,She's a child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,A tall child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Not that young.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Older.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Shae isn't going to like it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I should never have told you about that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You could buy a ship with these.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Of course you're not going anywhere.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't have a choice. My father-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I swear to you it will not be like that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You are. You'll always be my lady.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, today you have to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Could you-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Thank you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,There will be no bedding ceremony.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Nothing was ever wiser.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Astoundingly long.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And so my watch begins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You really ought to knock.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I have a list.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Who? Whom?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Why sheep shift?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,My lady-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Killed a few puppies today?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. I think armies give you power.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,The Northerners will never forget.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I will not rape her.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Sansa.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Keep up.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,She doesn't deserve this.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You have children. How happy would you say you are?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Even Joffrey?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,How long does it go on?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Please don't.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Ah, here we are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Can you read the sigils?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,And where is Prince Oberyn?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,You must be weary after such a long journey.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,trouble.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, they take all kinds."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I thought we were speaking truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't actually present.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I've heard rumors.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, you do need to eat."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I can't let you starve.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I swore to protect you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"I don't know, but I can try."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I haven't forgotten.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Things are a bit tense right now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I told you. It's not a good time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I don't love her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Ship you away?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What in the world are you talking about?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,It's only wine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,What about your left?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Oh, to be foreign."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't call me that.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need to do right by her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,By our children.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm not afraid.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need you to leave.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Better her than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw her board the ship?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw the ship sail away?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's someone following you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,My lady. My lady.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Your Grace does me a great honor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Let's find out.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,A noble effort.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Gone?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,They'll be following you now.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Are you going to accept their offer?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Her son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Well, you could set me free."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Then there's really nothing else to say.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Except I didn't do it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Really?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,No.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Not that I know of.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Choked on his pigeon pie.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Not going well, is it?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you think so?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Shae. Please don't.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You have new clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I sent for you days ago.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Doing what?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She's dim-witted.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Does he frighten you so much?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Because you're my friend.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, we did."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I think I would have remembered that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,That would have made things so much easier.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Nothing made him happier.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,For you. You drifted away.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Looks like very light armor.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Thank the gods.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,"Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,What're you doing?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,Who's helping you?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,Varys?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,"Jaime, thank you. For my life."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,"All my life, you've wanted me dead."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,I loved her.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,I murdered her. With my own hands.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,It doesn't matter?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,Say that word again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,I can't go back there. She's in there.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tyrion lannister,I am your son. I have always been your son.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Pentos?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Much better.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,In a box. Why stop now?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,The future is shit. Just like the past.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Not for a coward.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You never told me why you set me free.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You could have said no.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I'm not well-suited for work.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,What is it you want exactly?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Good luck finding him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,There's a bug.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I want to take a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Managed to kill a lot of people.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I'm losing my mind.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Slaves.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Curious... hair. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Well, , she's taken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I need to speak to someone with hair.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Hello?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,You've got no drink.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,That's because they've never met a queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Because you have a skeptical mind.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I'm not.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,Thank you. . Who are you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,Do you have wine?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,I can't sleep without wine.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Have you sailed this route before?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I would clap.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What was that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Mormont! Mormont!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Without luck?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,That's the best idea you've had all day.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,You're not hungry?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I only know what I heard
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,No.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Guess again.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Him.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,It's true. He has.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,If only I were otherwise.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I know.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,And did he?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I've heard stories.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,That's the one.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,No? Banish me?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Advise you on what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,The smaller man it is.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,My father would have liked you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can end this.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,Stay close!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Rusty” Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And I intend to help her do it.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,You betrayed her!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Pardon me?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Middling.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And drink. I've survived so far.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I did miss you.
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,For your baby To eat
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,I know what mhysa means
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,"Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,It's a problem
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,"Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,And have you started looking for that someone?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,tyrion lannister,"Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,You think them
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,Perhaps they can tell us their secret
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"Daenerys is the dragon queen Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,Dragons do not do well in captivity
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,That's what I do I drink and I know things
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they'll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,And did they ever harm you?
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,They will It's time they had their supper
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,I'm friends with your mother I'm here to help Don't eat the help
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you “It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,” I told him “It could be little, like me”"
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,But here you are
2016-05-01,Season 6,Episode 2,Home,tyrion lannister,"Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,That's good That's very good
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"There, that's a start"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Until you do
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you took your time"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You may be right
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Possibly
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,It's a conversation
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Long enough to know
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Friends, friends, friends, please"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Excellent
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I did
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Soon You have my word
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,We offered terms
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Those men respect you
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,As do I
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,For a short time
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,It's not enough.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Who said anything about “him”?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Welcome to Meereen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,She did indeed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,I'd settle for obeyed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That sounds most excellent --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'd call that a successful gambit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Look around. The city has come back to life.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I did and it worked.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'm going to miss you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Most of all, we need our queen."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The most famous dwarf in the world.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Now it's like a man reborn.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And who made these rules? Your former masters?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And you? What's your excuse?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,That's how you know it's working.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Do you like it?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Grey worm?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,It's funnier in Westeros.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Tell a joke.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Ah!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,You lied to us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. I admit it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"All right, what should the army do?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And then?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Perhaps we should take shelter.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,it proves that no one needs a Master.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Do we have a plan?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,We can agree upon that at least.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,The Seven Kingdoms.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,How did he take it?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,It's yours. Now and always.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,You are.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The bastard of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,and DAVOS shake hands.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Does she miss me terribly?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Forever.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Almost.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The Army of the Dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do actually.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good question.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I don't remember.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,They will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We took Casterly Rock.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We still have the largest army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We've discussed this.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,A smart one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,"Flee, you idiot!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,You fucking idiot.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Your Grace --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys is not her father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Who is that for?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Did you read it?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What's it say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking around the table closer to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,So bring the dead to her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,nods his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You're not staying here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What if someone takes the boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Listen to me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,He'll do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I honestly don't.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A million, give or take."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Cersei will anyway.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,It's good to see you again.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You might.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll be here soon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We are all facing a unique
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We all know that will never happen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You spoke with her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I didn't know about that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I have never been more sorry about anything.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Mm, not like this."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You're pregnant.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,My lord. My lady.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She did.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And our queen is grateful.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,They do make a handsome couple.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm not that old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Not as old as him.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What is that?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I know my brother-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was a fool.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Well, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Together again.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And the masses rejoice.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She's your new queen too.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I am.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Was she lying about the baby too?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,My cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How will he find you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Do you need help?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You've had a strange journey.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I'd like to hear about it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I wish Father were here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was speaking in relative terms.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Of course I miss it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,The perils of self-betterment.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Ser Davos, join us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Would you like a drink?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I think we might live.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"No, let's stay a bit longer."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Mmm.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,"If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,Maybe we should have stayed married.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,What a terrifying thought.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,A fitting reward for a hero.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you had your reasons.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,So did you?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You don't want it.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I envy you.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,There's something you need to know.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,He does.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was a mistake.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She trusts me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,But it doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I beg you, my queen-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She wants to attack now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to see the ...
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,How did they find you?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Did you consider taking it off?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Why?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Swear to me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'll find you later.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'm going alone.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Did you bring any wine?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,So is there life after death?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And she burned down a city for it.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Would you have done it?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You just came up with that?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's not for you to decide.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Me? The Imp?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.
