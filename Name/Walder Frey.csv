2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Why should l let him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Oh. And?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
