2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,What did you say to him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Why?

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Does he listen?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.

2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,That's not your concern.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What do you believe?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Will it hold?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Do you? Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Prepare to land.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,The dwarf has played his little trick.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,He can only play it once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Thousands.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Come with me and take this city!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Get the ladders up!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,"Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,No!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You claimed to speak for a god.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You talk about war as if you understand it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Have you? Show me how you fight.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Show me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I murdered my brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,He wasn't your brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I see fire.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Yes.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I heard you were dead.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,We are alone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I am fighting.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,How long will you be gone?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You're abandoning me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Then serve me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Why?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I want you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm the one true king.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,My lady.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I meant to come sooner. The battle-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"Yes, of course."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I believed that once.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,That's not true.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Shireen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You've grown since I last saw you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,He did. He fought bravely.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"He won't be visiting, child."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What do you mean to do with him?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You've slaughtered many lambs?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,They feeding you enough?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You don't belong in a place like this.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Melisandre's returned.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,She says there's power in king's blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Sacrifice him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,So did Renly.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You have little regard for your own life.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The boy must die.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,You don't deny it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,Why am I gonna need you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,When did you learn to read?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,I've made my decision.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,He was an infidel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,A good deal more than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Meat's off.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Of course I remember.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,What progress have you made?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Peasebury.
