2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,What are you doing?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Why?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You don't have to do this.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,But how?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,I don't like that woman.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What are you doing? Let go of him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,I don't talk to traitors.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,He's not my one true god.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Death.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,You swore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Why? So you can steal their gold?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,There's no one worse than you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,You're lying.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Is that the Blackwater?

2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't! Don't kill him.

2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I know they're still there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Might do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Mind if I keep warm?

2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're not very smart, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.

2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,You're lying.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks for the pie.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Nymeria?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Come with me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,That's not you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,In there. I live here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Which Lady Stark?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,We're not.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to face SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Of people I'm going to kill.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,You saw me?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,So did I.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Most of them are dead already.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Where did you get this?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's been awhile since I've trained.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,No one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,These are mother and father's chambers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,What?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Their opinions are important to you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Not if they lose their heads first.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,My lady.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,exits the room.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,starts a slow clap.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I wanted to.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was training.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I guess we'll never know.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I don't know yet.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,turns and walks away.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,Are you sure you want to do this?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,And what does honor demand?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,"All right, then. Get on with it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,My sister asked you a question.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,You told our mother
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,Are you all right?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,You did the right thing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I miss him.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You used to be taller.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Needle.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Once or twice.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Valyrian steel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Too heavy for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't forget that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Leave him be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,First I robbed you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Thanks. So do you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"Stay close to that forge, then."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't call me that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Here's my wish.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it or not?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You don't know any other rich girls.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You make my weapon yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,But you're a fighter.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You've fought them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,How many?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are they like?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Really bad""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I know Death.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,He's got many faces.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I look forward to seeing this one.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,My weapon?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're not leaving you alone out there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Dragonfire will stop him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Guess I've changed.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are you doing up here?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,For a little while.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,That for me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,This'll work.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What did the Red Woman want with you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Why your blood?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Was that your first time?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Your first time with a woman.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Or after?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You don't remember?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,One? Two? Twenty?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Yes, you did."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Get down to the crypt.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Take this and go.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Stick them with the pointy end.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,I know you.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,You said we'd meet again.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Not today.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,I'm going to kill her.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Sandor.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Thank you.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Let go.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Wait! Wait! No!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,You have to.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,"If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me."

2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
