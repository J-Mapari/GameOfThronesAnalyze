2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Inside you.

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I cannot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"Your fires burn low, my king."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,There is another way. A better way.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,Yes.

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,How many times has the Lord brought him back?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,That's not possible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You should not have this power.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You've been to the other side.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You have someone He needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Wildfire. I should have been here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Do you miss it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your blood is noble.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,There. Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You know what I mean to do with him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,And none have seen the blade.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Have you ever seen one like it?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Here, taste this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You think I'm trying to poison you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Where do you think it's from?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,There are no mistakes. Not for us.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You have to trust me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Take him away.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,My king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,"This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, show us the way..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,It's all I knew when I was a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Until he found me.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,And it frightened you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Come in, my queen. Please."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,You could never disturb me.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Not always.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,I understand how you feel.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,But that is impossible.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,The king wants a word.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Feel.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Are you a virgin?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Her father is the Lordo s chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,You march on Winterfell soon?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"You only need faith, my King."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,To serve my Lord.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Lord Commander.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? ."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,No visions. No magic. Just life.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Then we shouldn't tell him. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,"You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,You do know. Trust yourself.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,I trust in the Lord.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
