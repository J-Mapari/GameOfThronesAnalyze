2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Now that's what you want people to think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tywin lannister,The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tywin lannister,And who are these Companions of yours?

2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,tywin lannister,You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,You're wounded.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,He wasn't here.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what is their sigil?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And do you believe them?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,Fetch that water.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Can you read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,My cupbearer can read better than you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm. Give us the room.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Clear all this.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wine?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,What news from the capital?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Yes, yes, yes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wants to be queen.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,More wine for Lord Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,You would ride there yourself?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,And what else?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Who taught you to read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Quite a man. What killed him?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,No. But you've already begun.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Guard!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. Is that mutton?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Don't like mutton.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Leave it. Are you hungry?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Of course you are. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Yes. Dragons happened.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"And, girl."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,M'lord.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Go on.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,Surrender the Iron Throne?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,Too close to Casterly Rock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tywin lannister,The battle is over. We have won.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tywin lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Am I enjoying it?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,blows on his paper to dry the ink.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You want Casterly Rock?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,What news of Jaime?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're late.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your jokes are not appreciated.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,I can and I do.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Only too well.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You'll marry Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Why?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Old?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Never.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Your Grace.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You wanted to speak to me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"I have, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,We could arrange to have you carried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Where did you hear about this?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Apparently so.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You are being counseled at this very moment.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,You seem rather drunk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,More than once.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Not you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You really think a crown gives you power?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Does that amuse you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Easy for me, is it?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,It is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,From someone who no longer had need of it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,And now we have two.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll have to train your left hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll never be as good.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,No?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I don't believe I asked you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,What do you want?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Keep it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Proportionate to what?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,You're in rather a good mood.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I won't ask why.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Charmed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No one leaves the capital! No one!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,May we have the room?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No, thank you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Which way is that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Some believe the king choked.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,For which you blame me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Categorically.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I could arrange for this meeting.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A fortnight?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,And your wedding to Loras?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Shortly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Ourselves alone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"Go on, your best guess."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A tremendous amount.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
