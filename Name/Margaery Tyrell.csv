2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,As is your right. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Here, let me."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"You've never married, have you?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,We need to go home. Loras.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,There's no time for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't stay here.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,He was very handsome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,No. I want to be the queen.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,margaery tyrell,"With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Pardon me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,I have others.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And your mother?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You're such a dear.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You are the king.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,My father would never let me before-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,May I? Please.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Would you like to watch me?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Come on. Come walk with me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has he been kind to you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"You don't want him, though."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,If it's the pain you're worried about-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"You look radiant, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,It's the word that came to mind.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Of course. They play it so often here at court.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Gone.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,A shadow?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Joffrey is our king now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,And you've given none.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"Look, the pie."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,He's choking!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,So am I the queen?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,What was it like?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,But I would have been the queen.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Well, he could have done."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"You don't know, Grandmother."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,What? I don't understand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Very handsome.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Remember, our little secret."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,Your Grace.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,Long may he reign.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He sits the throne like he was born to it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"No, he wasn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He was my husband. My king.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I feel..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He has you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,We're late for dinner as it is.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,I'm very hungry.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,What's your name?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,"I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Lucky you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,No. You were lovely.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Yes. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,So strange… Husband.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,I love to sail.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
