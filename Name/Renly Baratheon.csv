2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Or you could even buy a friend.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not?

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Everywhere?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Ned! It's Robert.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
