2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"They're not your children.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jorah mormont,It's all a lie.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jorah mormont,"Aye, a small ship."

2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."

2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You swore an oath.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,With all my heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,King Robert wanted her dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,Which men do you have in mind?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Two hundred thousand if not more.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,I imagine you're right.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,He may not agree to meet.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,Mind your tongue.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Your men but not you?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Very good. We'll prepare.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,There may be others.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,That's what you call a few guards?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jorah mormont,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jorah mormont,"163, Khaleesi."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,The Lannisters have more.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"What, then?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Later than some.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,You have?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jorah mormont,I'm taking you to the Queen.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,Your captor.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,No.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,Then stay awake.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I'm not taking you to your sister.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,What business would you have with the Queen?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,We are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I am.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I think you'll be plenty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No. But the pirates are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,And then they weren't.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Get behind!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I suppose that's why they send them there.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I can.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Of course I'm hungry.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I am not your travelling companion.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Do you ever shut up?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Why?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,What do you know about my father?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,How?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,We better keep moving.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Do you believe in anything?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,No it doesn't.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Then she rules.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,This way!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Torgo Nudho.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Careful now.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,The second time thanks to you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,Ram
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,She's too smart to like it
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,I've been all over the world There's no escaping men like us
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,You know why
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,Of course it is
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,If you grow old
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,So do I
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,Not an army A horde
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jorah mormont,They have her
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,I'm fine
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,What?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,We need each other right now After we're done needing each other --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,Don't worry it didn't touch you
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,I know what happens
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,Come on
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?

2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,You must send me away.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,"Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."

2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,How long?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,But how long 'till...
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What are you doing?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What is it?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Have you ever done this before?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,A bit. Less than before.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,And the climate.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,How bad is it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I owe my life to her and you.

2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,nods to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
