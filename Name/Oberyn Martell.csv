2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Look at this one. How lovely is she?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You like?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're not timid, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you like women?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,The two girls can leave.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You stay.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Take off your clothes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,My way .
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,We don't like the smell.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Apologies, my love."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,What are you? His hired killer?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,How did that come to pass?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Even Dornishmen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I was invited to the royal wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I'm asking you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Not you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Greedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Your loss.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Does that surprise you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"What are you, 25?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,They will all have to line up behind you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Lord Tywin.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Would you like to sit?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some wine?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I'm sorry about your grandson.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I did. This is why I know.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You think we conspired together?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,The death of my sister.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,But you want something in return.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Why?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Your Grace.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"A poem, actually."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Not a very good one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,For one of my daughters.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Eight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Which joke is that?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We can avenge them.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Anything at all.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And yet everyone does.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Five years.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,One you don't like telling people.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You did like boys before?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,What then?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Everybody is interested in something.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Such as?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And did you?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Your sister.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I disagree.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I like to move around.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Today is not the day I die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to kill that.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Never.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Have they told you who I am?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
