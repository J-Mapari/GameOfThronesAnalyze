2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Kiss me, child."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Go on.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Naturally.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Good.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Impossible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Old.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,And you never-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Oh
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,olenna tyrell,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Nonsense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,My word.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,You dare not refuse.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,It feels proportionate.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,The expected extravagance.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,Help the poor boy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Idiots, help your king."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,How absentminded of me.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"He could have done,but he didn't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What veil?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't spar with me little fellow.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Hips.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't you walk away from me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What then?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I've read the seven pointed star.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,No you're not.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,And what did she want?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What kind of gift?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,olenna tyrell,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"Oh, this is madness!"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,What have they done to you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,We marched for you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Have you lost your mind?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,As a mindless fanatic.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,I will never leave you. Never.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,That is hardly your concern.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Good.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,What is your name again? Barbaro?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"Do shut up, dear."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Anything from you?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,And what is my heart's desire?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It's done?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,How will it happen?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Will there be pain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,That's good.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
