2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,We shouldn't be out here alone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Why not?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,If your father hears…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,He'll never know we've been gone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,But if he finds out…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,Are you sure?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,We shouldn't go in.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Of course we should.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Get out. Get out!
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,Let's go…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Listen to your friend.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,You don't know what I am.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Your blood. Give me a taste.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Three questions you get. You won't like the answers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,But I will be queen?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Will the king and I have children?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,That doesn't make sense.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,"Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,From all seven kingdoms…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will wait.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,This is exactly what they want.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Apologies.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Pentos?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Much better.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,My lord?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,In a box. Why stop now?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,The future is shit. Just like the past.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,prostitute,You want the same? Same as always?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,white rat,You… you don't have to.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,prostitute,Habit.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Sons of the Harpy?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,They've never killed before.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,"White Rat, your grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,Make them very angry.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,Torgo Nudho.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,Missandei hin Naath.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,I wanted to speak with you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,Why do you come?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,I do not know. I must go.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Get your shield up.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olly,It's too heavy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,"Shouldn't you be training, too?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,Not soldiers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,That one hates me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,All the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,Don't let them send us away.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,Sam! Don't let them send us away.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,"You can't leave, they'll execute you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,The king wants a word.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You're not cold, my lady?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Feel.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Are you a virgin?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Roose Bolton.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They're good men.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,It's where she belonged.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,It's a fair offer. More than fair.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I don't think that's likely.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"You admire him, don't you?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I respect him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Your grace…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,or he burns.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,How much time do I have?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master of arms,"Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,yohn royce,My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,squire,My lord.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master of arms,"Sword up, my lord!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,He has other gifts.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,Does he?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,But I'm you're squire.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Do you even know what a squire is?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,An attendant to a knight?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"Well, where would I go?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,"I don't care, I'm not your mother."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,You swore to find the Stark girls.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,Sansa still might.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,I did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,But we're heading west.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,We are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Thank you so much for your kind words.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grand maester pyrcelle,"Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel lannister,Your grace.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,My deepest sympathies.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan lannister,I apologize for my son's appearance.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Uncle, it's quite alright."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,Of course.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What can I do for you?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,You can forgive me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,I led you into the darkness.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I don't know what you're talking about.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,It looks like Dorne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,No it doesn't.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Sandstone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Fine.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,It's Dorne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,We're late for dinner as it is.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,You're very respectful.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,I'm very hungry.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,What's your name?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"Olyvar, my lady."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,"I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Lucky you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Unlucky you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Perhaps?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Imp, half-man."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Not for a coward.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You never told me why you set me free.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Your brother asked me to.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You could have said no.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I'm not well-suited for work.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I never said you were perfect.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,What is it you want exactly?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Good luck finding him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario naharis,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr zo loraq,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,They did ask for some concessions.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Concessions?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,No fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,If you--
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,How many times must I say no before you understand?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,You should reopen the fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,What?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Viserion? Rhaegal?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Easy. Easy. Easy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,So here we are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Here we are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"No, but it will be."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You know what Stannis wants?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Shouldn't a king be bold?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Then bend the knee and save your people.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They'll burn you alive.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,Kneel and live.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,braavosi man,"In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,He's just a statue.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,The House of Black and White
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,"Here, I leave you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Thank you for bringing me.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Valar dohaeris.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Hello. Valar Morghulis.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,old man,No one here by that name.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,old man,You have everywhere else to go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,But wait!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,"Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,"The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,Must be good food if it's crowded.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,waitress,Ale? Ale?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,You are becoming an observant young lady.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,So it was good news.?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,waitress,Ale?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I'll have some.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,My lady!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,What is it?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,Sansa Stark. Don't look!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,You sure?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Littlefinger?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,A bunch of knights with him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Ready the horses.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,We only have one horse.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Find more.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Do you like the taste?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,It gives some men courage.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,Does it give you courage?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,guard,That's far enough.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I was.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,It was after Renly's murder.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I tried to save him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,But you were accused.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,By men who didn't see what happened.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Then what did happen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,No.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,knight,He asked you to stay.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,guard,After her!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Podrick!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Stop, stop, stop! That's a good boy."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,knight,I guess that means you're unarmed.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Down, Podrick, down!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Podrick?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Yes, my lady?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,You can stand now.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,If they don't want your protection--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"No, my lady."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Get your horse.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,A summons from the queen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,There are only two like it in the world
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,It's a threat.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No note.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Softer.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,What?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Not so loud.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,The world can't know knows she's our daughter.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'll make things better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You never made anything better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm not going to ask him anything.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You go there with an army, it's an act of war."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I never said I was going alone.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys stokeworth,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,Don't they?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Don't who?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,You won't.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Pardon?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Oh.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,"She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,She is.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,Who's that?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Jaime fucking Lannister.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Ser Jaime.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Thank you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"This is my betrothed, Lollys."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,A pleasure.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"Run along, love."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Just get on with it.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,On with what?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,It's very good for you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I would have advised against that.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,How is this good for me?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Return from where?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,As far south as south goes.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,trystane,My future queen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,areo,The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,Captain. Let her pass.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,"Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,Your brother--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,What will you do about his death.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,You would have me go to war?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,You would have me go to war?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,The whole country would have you go to war.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,And how long will that be?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey worm,No one here. We go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,In a hurry? You're afraid?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey worm,Unsullied fear nothing.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,Fear is useful that way.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,It would send a message.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,How do you know that?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,Because I questioned him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,He is born free.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,And how do you know this?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,Everyone knows this.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Thank you all for your counsel.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,About what?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,About your father. About the Mad King.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I'm not my father.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,Your Grace.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,There's a bug.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You don't like it?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I want to take a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,The road to Meereen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,I told you. A ruler.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Still, a man of talent."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Managed to kill a lot of people.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,No.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Not him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hunters,"Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Take the head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Very good.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,Over there will be fine.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,You heard the man. Over there.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,You're the Hand of the King?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace tyrell,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"Oh, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,I must say I cannot see--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The king is very busy at this moment.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,What mission?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,That is not your concern as Master of War.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"Right, very good!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"I know ""S""."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,How old were you when you learned to read?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Three.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Did you ever see them?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,What did he do to them in the woods?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Mother.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,Leave us.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Your Grace.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,You need to stay away from that girl.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,She's a wildling.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Gilly wouldn't do that.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Who then? You?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,No. Only one of their own.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,The Lord Commander's niece.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,That amuses you?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,davos,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,Most likely.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,davos,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Unpleasant, I expect."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,You can give me the North.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,I'm going to refuse him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,alliser,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,men,"Hear, hear."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,Is there anyone else?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shadow tower brother,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,"If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Maester Aemon.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,Samwell Tarly. Go on.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,Sam the Slayer.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,janos,Lies!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,alliser,"I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,It is time.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brother,"It appears to be a tie, Maester."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brothers,Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,You. You!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,What have you got there?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,I said--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Turn around and go. Turn around and go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,"That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,men,"Quickly, go, go!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,old man,You lost this.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaqen hghar,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Well who are you then?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaqen hghar,No one. And that is who a girl must become.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,harpy,"She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"For you, Mhysa. You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mosador,and now you are the law!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,The law is the law. Take him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,crowd,Mhysa! Myhsa!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.

2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,Valar dohaeris.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,Good.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"No? Why come, then?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I want to serve. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Where are they taking him?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,bystanders,Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Did I hurt you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,No. You were lovely.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,It all happened so fast.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Yes. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,So strange… Husband.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Do you like to sail?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,I love to sail.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I do, too."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"Well, but I'm a man now."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I suppose.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I want you to be happy, mother."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Mother! . Welcome.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,You are very sweet.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,I'll leave you to it then. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's no need for such formalities.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Won't that be a lovely day.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Remember. Anything you need.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,He left you no choice.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,That's Moat Cailin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,No.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He did.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,He serves the Lannisters.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,For now.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,I won't go.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Winterfell is your home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Not anymore.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,No!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Sansa -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,How do we get through there?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,We don't. We go around. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,He hates that nickname.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,He borrowed it?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,As punishment. For both of you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Yes.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,I suppose that's more important.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,I was.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,He was.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But how did you end up serving Renly?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Lord Commander.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Your Grace.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I'd like to speak alone.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Say the word and you will be.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I can imagine no higher praise.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Are you bored of us already?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And the wildlings?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,As long as he's ruling them.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olly,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olly,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And what needs to be done?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What do you want?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,Who are you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,No one.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Ow! Cunt!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,"I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,You're about to find out.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,What are you doing?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,We were only playing. The game of faces.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,A girl is not ready.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,Clearly not.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I am ready.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What do we do with them after we wash them?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Open gates!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"Lady Sansa, welcome."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Lord Bolton.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,"Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Sam. . Maester Aemon?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,Greyguard is a ruin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Are you refusing to obey my order?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Take Lord Janos outside.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly, bring me my sword."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,"You have served us well, my son."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Thank you, Father."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,The Maiden.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,Where is the Maiden?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,And the Stranger.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,"Two is extra, you realize?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Yes, yes."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lancel,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,I am the High Septon of the -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lancel,You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Repent!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Shame on you!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,It doesn't matter. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You were assaulted?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,mace,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,pycelle,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,meryn,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Seven blessings.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Just a little more...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,Thank you ever so for the soup!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,Seven blessings to you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why no shoes?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Perhaps they're right.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,Your Grace.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"At once, Your Grace. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,How's your work coming along?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,Very well.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You've made progress?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"Shh. Easy, friend."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He seems pleased.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,Shouldn't he be?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,The Queen will be enraged.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I'd like to read the reply.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Volantis is a large city.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,It's a perfectly good face.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I'm losing my mind.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Slaves.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,Lord cast your light upon us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Lord cast your light upon us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,We should keep moving.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,I was once as you are now.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,"Bought and sold, , scourged and branded..."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I know. But I still love her.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,Are you lonely?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,Just bored.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"Were you bored a lot, too?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,I like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,Why do you say that?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,She shouldn't have said that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,"When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,Dressed for riding?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I am.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,Where are you going?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,King's Landing.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,King's Landing?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You can't leave me here!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,How do you know?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You don't know that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,And if you're right?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,I don't know how to do that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,His father frightens me.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Breakfast.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That would have been a shit way to die.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Sounds like all the rest.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,In the arms of the woman I love.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,She want the same thing?

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,And he's headed to Oldtown?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,As I said. Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,A bag of gold.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,It was a heavy bag.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you count?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Four.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you think you can take?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"One, if he's slow."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Halt!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you."

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Why are you here?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I thought the sharks would get us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,There are no sharks in Dorne.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Dolphins maybe.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Throw your swords in the sand.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Swords in the sand! Now!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That one should be slow enough.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Nice move! .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Luck.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,You had a wonderful teacher.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,First we need to bury these bodies.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Birds have to eat too.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyene,Nama!

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,"We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,nymeria,We may have a problem.

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,I made my choice long ago.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,Thank you. . Who are you?

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I'm not taking you to your sister.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,What business would you have with the Queen?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He sang to them?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He was good?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do with the money?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. ."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daario,"Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,hizdahr,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,hizdahr,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,I do not recognize this tradition.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,hizdahr,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. . Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."

2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Another step.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,But she does not give up on them.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,All men must die.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Maester Aemon.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,Lord Commander.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,How are you feeling?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,But you don't know what it is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What about you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What if I unchained you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Why would you do that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,And now everything is going to change?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Why now?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,We'll need ships.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,"You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,What?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Nothing.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,allister,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,And we've slaughtered theirs.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,edd,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It's not a trick.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,podrick,She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Aye.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Did you know Lord Eddard?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Everyone knows. The Boltons.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Who are you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Swore to who?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Her mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Her mother's dead.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come back here. Myranda.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I saw you staring at her.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,You said you'd marry me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Do you think she's pretty?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Never.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,"Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,"Oh, I don't need-"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,"You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,But who -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,You're not alone.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I like your dress. Who made it for you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I made it myself.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Really?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,"Who, who are you?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,My mother. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Thank you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I'd rather have a mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Down there at the end.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,What is it?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Theon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,You shouldn't be here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Do you have something to tell me?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Reek.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,She saw me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Who?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,She saw you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Give me your hand.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I forgive you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Allow me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,"Thank you, Ramsay."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,To your wedding.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,To your wedding.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,"Yes, master."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"That's his new name, Reek."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Why are you doing this?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Sorry about what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,For killing your brothers.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"Yes, yes, very good."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Wonderful. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,We're going to have a baby.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I'm very happy for you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,How can you be sure?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Sure of what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,So how did you manage it?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Manage what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Getting her pregnant.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And if it's a boy?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,You're worried about your position.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,You've never asked me about your mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Yes.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Is this every book there is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,Every book there is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,In the world.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Where's that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,I'm sorry I don't know things.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,Well -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,It's where they train the maesters.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Like Maester Aemon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Ah, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,You're Samwell Tarly?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I am, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I did, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,How?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Dragonglass?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,What the maesters call obsidian -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Seen what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,The army of the dead. And when they come -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,It's time.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"No need, they're coming with us."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"As you wish, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,Beg your pardon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,Is there going to be a battle?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,selyse,"That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Yes, my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,I'm not scared.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,I promise.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,You're still too weak. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,How long have I been here?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,Three days.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,Ser Barristan?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,All men fear death.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"My, my queen, please do not do this."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"Yes, my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,We are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I am.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Have you sailed this route before?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I think you'll be plenty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No. But the pirates are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,And then they weren't.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I would clap.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What was that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Get behind!

2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I suppose that's why they send them there.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Without luck?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,That's the best idea you've had all day.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Why?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.

More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Do you believe in anything?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,No.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,No it doesn't.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Then she rules.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,water.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sam tarly,PLACE - LATER
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,Salt mines.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,What about the dwarf?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Worthless. Cut his throat.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Guess again.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,"We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Him.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Is that true?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Liar.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,Lord Baelish.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Well done.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,That's not possible.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Ser Jaime, then."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And if you succeed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,As I said. I live to serve.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,What if he says no?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,We can't. Not yet.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,Why not?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,You know why not. Someone will see.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,"Yes, my prince."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,I remember how.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"Alright, thats enough."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,I'm coming to the best part.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,This song really is all about the ending.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,It can wait. Up there.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,That's the Water Gardens.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,I like to improvise.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,That explains the golden hand.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ellaria,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sand snakes,For Oberyn.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Well, she's made herself at home."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Myrcella.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Let's speak in private.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I am Trystane Martell.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,Trystane is my intended.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Excellent. Good to meet you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,"We weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,Let's not do something stupid.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,No!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,That was something stupid.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,You hurt him!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,Oh for fuck's sake.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,You're coming with me.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,I don't want to!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,"I wasn't asking, princess."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,Drop you weapons!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,Drop your weapons!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",rider,Halt!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,But he was the king's brother.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Cersei is behind this.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,You must be exhausted.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Beg your pardon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What veil?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,I don't pay attention to rumors.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,He was my friend. He was my king.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Wearing Renly's armor.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Why does it matter what I wore?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Of course I deny them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Never.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Nor any other man.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,That will be all Ser Loras.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,You call me forward?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Yes. We have some questions for you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,I am the queen.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,They are lies.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,All of them?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,All of them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,"Yes, I swear it."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Thank you, your grace."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Do you know this man?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,How did you come to meet?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,And what occurred in his chamber?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,We engaged in intimate relations.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You laid with him?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,That night and many others.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Liar! He's a liar!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Liar!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,What?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Tommen! Tommen!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,"You can't do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,What do you want?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Hunt?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,What was your name again?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,Myranda.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me."

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",theon greyjoy,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,I'm not touching you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",theon greyjoy,Please. He'll punish me.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Do you think I care what he does to you.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,"Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,You're not lying to me?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,"No, my lord."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?"

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Good. Now take off your clothes.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,What else?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,The Stormcrows rode off last night.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,And?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,"This isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”"

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,It's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,"

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"I've trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,"You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,I don't know what I saw.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,You do know. Trust yourself.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"And you, do you trust yourself?"

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,Are you sure?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,We don't have Robert's bastard here.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,"No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,Have you lost your mind?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,Do you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,Get out.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,derryk,"The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bran stark,"Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,derryk,"Come on love, give us a kiss."

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sammy,Just a bit woozy.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,"Don't be stupid Sam, you're not a fighter."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Just promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,I need more water.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,Stay. Please.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Am I hurting you?

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,"A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,13. Do I have 14?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Why?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,He's funny. You have to give him that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Alright. He's funny.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Yes.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buer,"Here's your wages, funny man. It'll last the rest of your life."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Are you jealous?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I do.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,You're right. My motivations are entirely impure.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Doesn't make me wrong.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,So what else can I do?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Marry me instead.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"Why not? You're our queen, you can do as you like."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,No. I can't
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Then you are the only person in Mereen who's not free.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"I know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Of course
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,All rulers are either butchers or meat.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't spar with me little fellow.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"For me, it's the knees. You?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Hips.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Huh.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,The people always do the dirty work.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,A useful talent.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't you walk away from me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What then?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I've read the seven pointed star.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Yes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,squire,Lady Olenna.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,She's in a prison cell and there's nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there's nothing I can do!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I love her. I love her. I can't help her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Your happiness is all I want in this world
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I know.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,areo,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,And more hands. How's Trystane?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,He'll be alright.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,Why is it happening at all?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,"It's not complicated at all, it's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I don't understand.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,Of course you don't! You don't know me!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,He's got a good voice.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,obara,We're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,It's against my code to hurt a woman.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,obara,It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I wouldn't say you beat me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,How's your arm?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,You think you're leaving Dorne?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Thank you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Name one more beautiful than I am.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,"Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Was I?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,How's your arm now?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,And how about your head?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Your nose is bleeding.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,It's nothing. It's the dry air.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,"My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Sorry? Who?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,You.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Don't drop it.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,I think you're very handsome as well.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I'm sorry about the locale.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,No you're not.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,It felt like the safest place.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I promise you..
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,And what did she want?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What kind of gift?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,slave owner,"Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Valar morghulis.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,Valar dohaeris.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Prepare yourselves.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Move yourselves!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I think I've seen enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Get him out of my sight.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,It's true. He has.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,I know you did this.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,I don't want to see you again.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,Leave.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,Get out you hateful bitch!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Sleep well, sister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Thank you. You saw her?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,And?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Who will stand judge?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Will you be one of them?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,I will.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,What does The Mother's mercy entail?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I think I may have heard at one point.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Who carved this altar do you know?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I'm afraid i don't.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,And he has much to say about you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Move. Let me go immediately.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,end,EPISODE
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,If only I were otherwise.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I know.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, many opportunities."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,And did he?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No. Not until forced to do so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should kill him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Confess.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My son. Let me speak to--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Confess. I meant it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My face will be the last thing you see before--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,How will she serve him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,What will she do there?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,She will see.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,See what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Your oysters fresh?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,Best in the city.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Can't do it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,"Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,And then what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A gift for the Thin Man.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,She is not ready.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,And if she's not?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,The charges?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,All lies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,Tell him I need to speak to him.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can't stay here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Why. Why Theon.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't. They were only--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Only what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I can't..
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Tell me!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"I can't, not unless the master says..."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Tell me, they weren't what?!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't...
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,You didn't…?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I can't talk to you anymore.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"Not Theon, Reek!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton bannerman,"Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,"And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,You disagree?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,"Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,And what do you recommend?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,It's probably my safest option.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And what would your father do?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Is that why you killed him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I've heard stories.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Which kind is that?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,But you trust him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The brother who killed my father.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,That's the one.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to kill you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,No? Banish me?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Advise you on what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,How to get what I want.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The common people.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,You struck me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,"You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Thirsty? Confess.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,Does it hurt?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,Good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,How are you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,You know what I mean.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I'm good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Are you scared?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,A little.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Me too.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Who's there?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Olly.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Come in.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,I heard what happened.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Figured you were hungry.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,You're a good lad.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I need to check on baby Sam.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Now then. How can I help?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,It's about the Lord Commander.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Yes?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,We've been fighting them for years.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,"The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Olly...
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,How can he trust him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,You believe that?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,With all my heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,You trust me Jon Snow?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Does that make me a fool?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,We are fools together now.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,War.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You don't give the orders here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I'm not giving an order.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,Why aren't you in chains?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He's not my prisoner.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,What is he?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're allies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I don't fight for the crows.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,"Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,Gather the elders and let's talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,You built that wall to keep us out.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,You saw this?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,No. But I trust the man.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,Come with you where?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,If…?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Where is Mance?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He died.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,How?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,I put an arrow through his heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,This is the way.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wildling elder,I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,giant,Tormund.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,I fucking hate Thenns.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,How many are with us? 5000?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I'm not good at counting.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're leaving too many behind.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,And he knew them better than I ever will.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daughter,I wanna go with you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wun wun,Lokh kif rukh?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Shut the gate.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Shut the gate!!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,shouting,Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Ready your arrows!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get in line! Get in line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Hold the line! Hold the line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,nights watch brother,Lord Commander!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,brother,But you'll never make it--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Now!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You should be on one of those boats.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You have my word. I've given orders.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,The Dragonglass!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"You're with me, lad! Now!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Get the glass.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,edd,Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Go! Go! Go!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"Wun Wun, to the sea."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Let's go now! Now!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,end,EPISODE
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Horses?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,We're not returning to Castle Black.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,Open the gates.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,It was a failure.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,It wasn't.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,"I went to save them, I failed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Your Grace, you've named me your Hand."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Yes.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,My family stays with me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,What's this one now?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,The Dance of Dragons
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Well that sounds like a proper story.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,And burnt him to a crisp.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Do you like it?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,He's beautiful.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Thank you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,You're very welcome.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Of course I will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,But why am I getting a present?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,You'll just have to read it yourself.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Doran.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Princess Myrcella.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,Uncle.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,What a lovely dress.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,You don't like it?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You must be cold.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,A fleabite.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,What are you doing in Dorne?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,That necklace was stolen from my room.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I'm afraid he does.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I accept.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,The word of a Kingslayer.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You're a good man.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,On one condition.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,"Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,You're going to miss.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,I never miss.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,Luck.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,Now it's my turn.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,You're too slow. You've always been too slow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,areo,You'll find out very soon.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,The most beautiful woman in the world.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,And that's the truth!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,Slut.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Only the one.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,There was one condition.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,Perhaps some soup instead?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,How much for your little clam?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,thin man,Come on.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,thin man,"Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm afraid I don't partake.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I don't have that gift.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,"It wasn't bad, though."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,You're buying?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,brothel keeper,Sell your fish somewhere else.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,prostitute,"Oh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,prostitute,They say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,Three coppers.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Too old.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head prostitute,Brea.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,"I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Do you have what I want or not?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Of course. Of course.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,I'll have one.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Good.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,I'll tell you when we're done.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Of course.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,"I'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,Valaar morghulis.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,And?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,Perhaps that's why the man is thin.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,Tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,Tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,A girl has work to do.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,You write like a 7 year old.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,He didn't try to make you pay?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,She will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"You love her very much, don't you?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Of course, she's my niece."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,I wasn't talking about her.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Father. Aren't you cold?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,No. What are you reading?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,The Dance of Dragons.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,What's it about?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,That's just what they call it.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Doesn't make much sense.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,I think it's poetic.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"It's alright, father."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,You don't even know what I'm talking about.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Yes there is.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Forgive me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Where's my father? I want to see my father.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,"If we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,I can't.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,There's no other way. She has King's blood.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Mother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,No...
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Where have you been?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Just making sure everything's in order.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,"Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,"My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,quick,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,strong,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,They're waiting for you. Clap your hands.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,The smaller man it is.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,You don't approve?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,That is greatness?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,My father would have liked you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,We ask again
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,At your command?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If need be.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,A Meereenese champion?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,How many people will die to make this happen?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Someone else's reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,or a Westerosi Knight?!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Your Grace--
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,Shut your mouth.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can end this.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,She cannot.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,Protect your queen!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,Stay close!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,This way!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"The other side, follow me!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Drogon!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Valahd..

2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,melisandre,"The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,We ride for Winterfell.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,melisandre,And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,Your Grace.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Prepare to form up.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Tell me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,The men. Many deserted before dawn.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,How many?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,"Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,Your Grace?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Cut her down.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,So what are you gonna do?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,But… the Dragonglass?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,But… you killed a White Walker.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"Well, there's Edd."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,They'll bloody try.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,Very carefully.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,I'll come back.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,To your return.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,To my return.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,podrick,My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,How do you know it's Stannis?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,podrick,He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,"There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Bolton has women fighting for him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,I did.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,"Go on, do your duty."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,Looks like we're done here.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,survivor,I surrender. I surrender!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,And I accept your surrender.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,theon greyjoy,Go with her. Please.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sansa stark,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,"Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,Stop! Stop!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,man,Open the gates!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,theon greyjoy,He's coming back.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,meryn,I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,I can't hear you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,Do you know who you are?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,You're no one. You're nothing.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,I was right about her.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,You were.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,You're not ready. Not at all.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,That man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,Only death can pay for life.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,"No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,Why are you crying?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,He was my friend.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,He was no one.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,But if you're… Who's this?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,The faces are for no one.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,You are still someone.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,And to someone…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,the faces are as good as poison.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,I can't see!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,What's happening?! What's happening?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,doran,I wish you a safe journey home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ellaria,Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,bronn,Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyene,Maybe I'll come visit you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,bronn,Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyene,"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"Whenever you're ready, My Lord."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Try not to lose it this time.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I'll never take it off again.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,Do you think mother will like him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,And you really believe that?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,She likes you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,No you don't.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I know what you're trying to say.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,No. I'm afraid you don't.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I do.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Does he always talk so much?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,Jorah the Andal.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Torgo Nudho.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,You should not be here.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"No, but he is."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Our queen would be dead if not for him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,It's true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,A bit “rusty”.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Rusty” Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,You missed a good scrap.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And I intend to help her do it.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,You betrayed her!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Careful now.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,The second time thanks to you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Pardon me?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Can you fight?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Are you good on a horse?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Middling.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,So mainly you talk?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And drink. I've survived so far.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I am.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,"It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,voice,"Hello, old friend."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I did miss you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"Oh, I know."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,We have to go home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,How far did you carry me?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,septa,Confess. Confess.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,You wish to make a confession?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Name him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Lancel Lannister.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Your cousin. And the King's squire.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I was lonely and afraid.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,You had a husband.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,His sins do not pardon your own.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,May the gods forgive me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Other men?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,No.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,No others?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I do.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Trial? I have confessed?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Thank you. Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Good.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Am I free to go?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,After your atonement.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,My atonement?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,septa,Shame. Shame. Shame.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,crowd,Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,woman,I've had half as many cocks as the queen!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,man,"Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,Your Grace. It's good to have you back. Come. We'll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,"If it please Your Grace, he's taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace's enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,The wildlings will make a difference!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,It's not their fight!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Stannis?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,Shireen? The princess?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,olly,Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,olly,Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,He could be lying.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Could be. There are ways to find out.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Where is he?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Over there.
