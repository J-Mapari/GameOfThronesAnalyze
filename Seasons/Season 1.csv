2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"You can always say no, Ned."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maester luwin,I'm told he drinks all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"In any case, candles."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I promise.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,D'you know what?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,What?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Move!

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Where's the Imp?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Will you shut up?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Arya.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Would you please shut up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ned.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,We both did.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I'm not worthy of the honor.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I did hear something about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,And the other brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,The queen has two brothers?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,I hear they call him the Imp.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Clever girl.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Have you?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Don't get up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,M'lord.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Close the door!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,She belonged with me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Not all of them.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maid,"It's too hot, my lady."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where is he?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Come forward, my dear."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where's he going?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The ceremony is over.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When will they be married?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Is it true they lie with their horses?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Do you take me for a fool?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't know.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,He's so handsome.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Sansa…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Is he dead yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Uncle Benjen!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,So take me with you when you go back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Jon…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I'm ready to swear your oath.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I don't care about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What're you doing back there?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The two he was with are still missing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,A wildling ambush.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Uncle Benjen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Robb boy. How are ye?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I'm good.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"I think so, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And have you bled yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"No, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I hear the same.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Your pardon.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I don't fight in tournaments.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,No? Getting a little old for it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Well said.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Time for bed.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I won't let him take you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,How did he get so fat?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,a voice,"It's Maester Luwin, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Send him in.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Stay.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,What news?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,A different time. Different king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,When their omens favor war.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, Magister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Make him happy.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,khal drogo,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Do you know the Common Tongue?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,"Rough night, Imp?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"No, but I'm still better than you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I hope I'll serve you well.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,"Come on, you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Stop. STOP.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Are you completely mad?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,It's all right. It's all right.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,Ten
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Ten.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,The things I do for love.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Isn't there anything else?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Khaleesi!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Your hands.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"As you wish, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,What good will my sympathies do them?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I'm telling mother!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,You can't...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Do you understand?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Little brother.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Beloved siblings.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,myrcella baratheon,Is Bran going to die?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Apparently not.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Please.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I never knew.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I am grateful..
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,A sword for the wall?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I already have one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Of course I have.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Soon enough.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It's good you've got help.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Impressive.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,A present?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,It's so skinny.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I can be quick.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I think so.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,First lesson
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I know which end to use.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,You've said it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I want you to leave.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I have no choice.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can. You must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,My mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,She was very kind.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It was always my color.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Farewell, Snow."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"And you, Stark."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I've half a mind to go with you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I recall a few chances.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Bessie. She was one of yours.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Wylla.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Nor will I.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,She's little more than a child.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Why do you read so much?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Is this a trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Talk to Poole about it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't care about appointments!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,When was the last time you left this room?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have to take care of him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,assassin,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever seen a dragon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Everywhere? Even in the east?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jhiqui,It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,The moon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,How old were you?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Nine?!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Yes.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Will it take three years?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Welcome.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll ride to King's Landing.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Mother, you can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,What about Bran?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Finish a man?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Pardon me, Ser."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,I'll get you!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,What are you doing here? Go away.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"Mycah, my Lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,He the butcher's boy.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,He's my friend.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Stop it!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, stay out of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Nymeria!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Please don't.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Then go! Don't touch me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,It's a direwolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I'll check down here.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I think I heard a noise.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Go!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Where is she?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,She's been taken directly before the King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Who took her?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Lannisters found her.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Right, get back."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I'm sorry.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Are you hurt?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not what happened!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Shut up!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,In bed asleep.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar! Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop it! That's enough of that.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop! Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Gladly, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,So be it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,We have another wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,As you will.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can't mean it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,s this your command... your Grace?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Where is the beast?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"Chained up outside, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Is this some trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He ran... Not very fast.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,"Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jory cassel,"Yes, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,But you just stood there and watched.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lord Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Grand Maester.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,And you served another King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Without the King?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Can the treasury bear such expense?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,How could you let this happen?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,It's ugly.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,Do I have to marry her?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I don't want to.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How would you handle them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,A royal army?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,For me. I'm their King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I'm not asking.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm practicing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,Practicing for what?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Prince.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Arya, stop!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,The Hound killed your friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,You're an idiot.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Enough!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,What's happening here?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,You've barely eaten a thing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's all right. Go on.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,War was easier than daughters.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Go away!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Mine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's called Needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,laughs] That's the essence of it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,So was I! He is a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Winter is coming.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I don't hate her. Not really.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I can keep it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I hate your stories.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,What are you telling him now?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Maybe we do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Don't ever say that.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I'd rather be dead.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,My Lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Follow me, Lady Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lady Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I must admit I do not.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Yours?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,To whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,Next!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,A charming man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Good news or bad?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Both.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,My wife is in Winterfell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Is she?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,It's an improvement.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,What do you care about our faces?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,We have proof. We have the blade.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How could you be so stupid?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Calm down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Then what are you raving about?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And my husband?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Let me go.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Never.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I wish I could see the girls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's too dangerous.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Just for a moment.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Until we know who our enemies are...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if you find the proof?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,He still loves you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Does he?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Off with you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"Of course, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Who was it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,How'd you do it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,Lance through the heart.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,"It's empty, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What do you mean it's empty?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,There's no more wine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Your outlaw... Any last words?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,From whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Tell them all to stop.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Until I command them otherwise.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,No!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,You walk. [to Viserys]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,You're leaving?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,What kind of reports?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,The kind I don't want to believe.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,But I'm better than every...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,A bear's balls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,You're joking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,Call me what you like.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,I always do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Armor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,There are no rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,She does not want to eat horse.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,All of them brief?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,It's a boy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,khal drogo,How do you know?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,I know.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"Farewell, My Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Who are you?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's too heavy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,What if I drop it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm a girl.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,A needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",old nan,The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We have visitors.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to see anyone.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to go.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,He has no memory of that day.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Curious.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Why are you here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Kneel, Hodor."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I'm not a cripple.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,Will I really be able to ride?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,He's not my master.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Careful, Imp."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,What in seven hells is that?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,Tell them your name.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,Come to take the black pudding.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"I yield. Please, no more."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Enough! He yielded.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Well fought!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Piss off.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Did he hurt you?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I've had worse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why didn't you get up and fight?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why not?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,But if they did?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And you know these men?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You sold slaves.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Aye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And where is she now?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,They do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,It's entirely possible.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Really? Why dragons?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What have you seen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pirate ship?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,A dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the skulls?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,That's very sad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,I wouldn't worry about that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,But what if?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And everyone would hate me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nobody could ever hate you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Joffrey does.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Please shut up about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Why were they killed?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You should speak to your father about these matters.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",janos slynt,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,Dreadful.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Jon want the night before he died?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,He came inquiring after a book.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A book? What book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to read it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,Such a tragedy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,What else could it be?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Poison.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Everybody knows that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,He's right about that.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.

The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Varys or the Queen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"As you can see, I'm busy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Let them look.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Lord Arryn want?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,He always came to see the boy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to see him as well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,This is fine work.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,It's not for sale.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,I made it for me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Forgive him, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What kind of questions?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your mother?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"Who she was, what she looked like."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did you tell him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Find anything?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,King Robert's bastard son.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Three? Four?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"We've met before, you know."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,That's where you got your scar?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Vicious sons of whores.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,They like their bloodshed.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Theon? He's a good lad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Where have you been?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Watch duty. With Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,He wasn't hungry.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Impossible!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,No one touches Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why did you hit her?!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What's this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Please.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,This stinks of manure. All of it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Stop - stop it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You do not talk back to me!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I find that hard to believe.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I know where to put it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,What color hair?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Red.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,You don't want to know.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,That good?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Better.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,What's my name?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Jon Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,It is a bit nippy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I build my own fires.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,He is still the true King.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The truth now
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Arya!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Don't be rude!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Gods, who is that?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And his opponent?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your Grace.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,She likes it here.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What are you doing here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,As was I.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rodrick cassel,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bronn,You can have my room.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house whent,She is.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house bracken,Our lord is honored by his trust.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'd never worn this armor before.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who determines the draw?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Yes. That will never happen.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Robert tends to do what he wants.

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're too fat for your armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lancel lannister,"No, Your Grace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're torturing the poor boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The breastplate stretcher?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long before he figures it out?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Maybe you should have one invented.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And who's going to hit you back?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'm not thirsty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Robert?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'll take that bet.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Or you could even buy a friend.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,He's going to die.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Ser Loras rides well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I owe you my life, Ser."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sandor clegane,I'm no Ser.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Remove his hood.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,marillion,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,I did... often and loudly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,And why would I do that?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,Should I gag him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"My Lady, this way."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Family comes first?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,And then she left!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Might surprise you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Hmm?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You are jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,And what about the Starks?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You're a very serious boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Then get yourself a wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,But his mind is sound?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So they say.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I didn't trust you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So why do you trust me now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What sort of doom does the King face?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who gave it to him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Someone who could afford it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He started asking questions.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,This Hand is not the other.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,It never was.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You do move quietly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,We all have our qualities.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Strictly speaking.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Eyes I own.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,One shudders at the thought.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Oh.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Have you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Was that you under the bed?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, please."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To a small council meeting?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,Off with you. No begging.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I want to see my father.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,They said they were going to kill you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who did?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Oh, Arya."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Where did you hear this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What were you doing in the dungeons?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Chasing a cat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Your name, friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm a girl!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Did Benjen send you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Know what?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Best said in private, my Lord."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Go on. We'll talk more later.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,How many guards does my father have?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Well?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,To whom do I speak?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,There was no time to send word.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,My sister will decide what he looks like.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,I like you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I need to see the King first -- alone.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Is it about my wife?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,The whore is pregnant.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're speaking of murdering a child.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Based on whose information?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,grand maester pycelle,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,We should have had them both killed years ago.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,She dies.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will have no part in it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What can I do for you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Why? What do you care?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I don't have the time.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Heward and Wyl.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Find them and meet me at the stables.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,It is.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,He's little.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mord,"You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You're jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Are you sure this won't hurt?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Only if I slip.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,And you prefer me like this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Mhmm.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I want you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hold still.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Everywhere?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I have an outrageous amount of money.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,But a lot more than you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Do you know who should be King?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Be serious.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'm fourth in line.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Stannis?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,He's still my older brother.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,What are you doing?!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Look at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,You cut me!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,We still outnumber them.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Five.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What do you want?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Our marriage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Every day.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long can hate hold a thing together?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,So why now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I know.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,How many?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jory!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,My Lord.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Such a small pack of wolves.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I remember him well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,If you threaten my Lord again...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Your pardon, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Do you know what your wife has done?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,She did nothing I did not command.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Who'd have thought she had it in her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,I am the King's Hand -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You were the King's Hand!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,trying to keep the peace -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You shall now be held accountable.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,He butchered my men.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I took you for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Hold your tongue.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,If we don't act… there will be a war.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,The hunt?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,The Targaryen girl -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,When are you gonna tell him?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Not now.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You're talking about war.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm talking about justice.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,"And it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Where's Bran?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I don't know. It's not my House.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,Robb?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,All alone in the deep dark woods.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I can't. The saddle, the straps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,Robb!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Shut up! Drop the blade!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Are you all right?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"Yes, it doesn't hurt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You don't have the right -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,What about her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,We'll keep her alive.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Dwarf man still making noise.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold! Fuck off.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't want to practice today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,No?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You are troubled.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Yes -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't like dolls and k -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,The old and the new.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's doing well.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,She'll never keep it down.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell me what she is saying.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's going to have a boy.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,They love her.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She truly is a queen today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,It's not my law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,They don't belong to you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Whatever is hers is also mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"Once, perhaps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And you have all three.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,It means everything to me.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,And yet here you stand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And here I stand.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Noise again!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,About the gold -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Where?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,You want free? Go be free.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,What message?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You wish to confess your crimes?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Silence!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,What happened next?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,What do you think you're doing?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Confessing my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,catelyn stark,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,I understand the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You have that right.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"I'll fight for you, my Lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,It'll be my honor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Make the bad man fly!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Agreed.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You demanded a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The trial will be today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,I'll stand for the dwarf.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lancel lannister,"More wine, your Grace?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, what was I saying?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,A simpler time.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barriston,"It was, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Sounds exhilarating.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"Once, I think."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Those were some lucky girls.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barristan selmy,"I don't believe so, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Those were the days!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"Brigands, most likely."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Wel…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,beric dondarrion,As you command.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Grand Maester Pycelle.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My Lord.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Is it over?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You don't fight with honor!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,No. He did.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Can I make the little man fly now?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My mother isn't from the North.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I'm aware of that.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Yes. I have hair.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,I've never seen it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Would you like to?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I come from a very small village in -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Sansa -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Septa.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Now you are being rude.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,There's nothing to forgive.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Going to King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,And you can afford that?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Some of my friends are more generous than others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll have lots of company…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,See what?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm going to miss you!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I know.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Listen -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What about Joffrey?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,What? No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Please, Father. Please don't."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Can't we take Syrio back with us?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Seven hells.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Wait!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Come on!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's not fair!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That is no place for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,You are no king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Keep away from me!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"Viserys, please."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,What's he saying?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Look away Khaleesi.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Dany please!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,A crown for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khaleesi…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Attacking him was stupid.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Lannisters don't act like fools.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Catelyn Stark took my brother.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Why is he still alive?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Ned Stark.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,It wouldn't have been clean.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Clean...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Now that's what you want people to think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,It's the truth.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Of course it bothers me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You're in pain.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I've had worse, my lady."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Perhaps it's time to go home.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Has he done this before?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime would have killed him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Your brother Or your lover?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,My son saw you with him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Do you love your children?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,No more than I love mine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,And they are all Jaime's.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Thank the Gods.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You've always hated him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Hated him? I worshiped him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Oh, but it was."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,"Yes, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,"Why don't you join us, My Lord?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I'm saving myself for another.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,A stupid saying.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,She must be very beautiful.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,I do believe my lordo s in love.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,For many years. Most of my life really.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,And what do you want?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Where is it you come from?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,And what's that?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I will be lord after my father.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,So you're not lord now?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to worse than him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why did you come here?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why? What are you afraid of?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Owls and Shadowcats and...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,"The ""things"" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I miss girls.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Why is he alone?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Robert, my sweet..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Out, all of you!"

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,Give it to the council after I'm dead.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I will.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,My memory.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Give him milk of the poppy.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,barristan selmy,He was reeling from the wine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No man could have protected him from himself.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,barristan selmy,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,His squire? The Lannister boy?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,I'm afraid those birds have flown.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Not dirt. Lands.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"Lands, yes..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,It's not a chair. It's a...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Can't you help me make him understand?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,And because he had dragons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,You don't believe it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,Princess.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,That? Dornish swill.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"You honor me, Ser."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,The honor...the honor is all mine.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Is something wrong?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,I have a thirst. Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Pour.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Do as he says.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,As the princess commands.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,"Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,You first.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,You will drink.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,doreah,Khaleesi! Stop him!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Come.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jeor mormont,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Do you take me for a servant?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,May I go?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,As you wish.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,She won't care.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What about Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is your older brother.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tell me something,Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tomard,"Yes, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Now leave us.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,My Lord protector.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The King has no true born sons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So when the King dies...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"There is no ""unless""."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Do you have a shred of honor?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,We?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What you suggest is treason.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Only if we lose.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No. I won't do it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You promised Catelyn you would help me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,He will not have my son.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,Liar!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You think he stands alone?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,janos slynt,Men of the Watch!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I want no bloodshed.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Now!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"Yah! Left high, left low."

2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Hush! Go back to your room.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,What is it? What's happening?
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Do as I told you. Run!
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"This way! Left, right."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,"You said right, but you went left."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,And now you are a dead girl.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,Only 'cause you lied.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,My tongue lied.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,meryn trant,"Arya Stark, come with us."

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Robb? He's just a boy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Have my horse saddled and ready.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l agree. l'll go.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,everyone,You can't!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Unless there was a profit in it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stevron frey,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,ryger rivers,"Father, please –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,ls there somewhere we can talk?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"He is quite ill, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"My lord, l –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure there were reasons –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Why should l let him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You swore an oath to my father.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Why don't you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,voices outside,And engage!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Soon, he says."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,This is Valyrian steel.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,unidentified nights watchers,Well done. Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,"You earned that, Snow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Go on, let's have a look."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,At what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,The sword! Show us the sword.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,all,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,Let's have a look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Piss off.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Look at its eyes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What is it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l - l can't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You can't what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l'm really not supposed to say.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What? What about him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l should be there. l should be with him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Well? What did he say?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Huh.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,What does he want in return?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"Fine, fine. And?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,She won't be happy about that. And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l did.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,One was – Do you consent?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Can l refuse?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Not if you want to cross.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Then l consent.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam told you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,My horse…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cohollo,Blood of my blood…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,"No, l must ride."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Shagga likes axes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,They do seem rather ferocious.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l took her.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Took her? From whom?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,He said something.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Who would you like me to be?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Shae. What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What sort of accent is that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Foreign.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,For-
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What do you want from me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,And what do l get?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who told you this? Women you paid?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Let's start with your last night in this world.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l won't leave him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,The wound has festered.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You did this, witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,l think you're right.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,You've saved me once more.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,And now you must save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Do it. Save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a price.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My death?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Kill her and you kill your khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,Go. Now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Take her and leave. Take her!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,No one will enter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring him back to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have to save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This must not be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,This must be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Witch.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,Nothing good will come of this.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"No, you can't."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,irri,Khaleesi!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"No further, horselord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Are you hurt?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,The baby –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Hmm?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,is coming.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Fetch the midwives.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Just used to it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Let's play a new game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Not if you win.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What are you good at?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,This sounds like a boring game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play this game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,But my mother hit harder.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What brought you up there?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Work.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Are you sure –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,My turn.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who were you in love with?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,That's not how the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't care the way the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Married?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did you hear that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Not another night. This night.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Oh, maybe l will cry."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You should have known she was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You are still young and stupid.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What is it? What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're sleeping through the war.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Get my squire!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You don't have a squire.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You'll be dead. How will you know?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'll know.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Watch out! Move!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Out of the way! Move aside!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Stay low.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Stay low?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tribesmen of vale,Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,To battle!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're a shit warrior.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'm alive?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're alive.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Did we win?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Yeah, good."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,You're wounded.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,He wasn't here.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where was he?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And where are they?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,"We should go, my lady."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,No!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,My lady!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark bannermen,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's more use to us alive than dead.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Take him away and put him in irons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"Come on, pretty man."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Three coppers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,How about a nice fat pigeon?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,"Oh, piss off now. Go on."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Piss off!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Who?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,The Hand of the King.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Coward!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,Baelor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Traitor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grand maester pycelle,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,joffrey lannister,"My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sansa stark,"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cersei lannister,"My son, this is madness."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Put him down!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,yoren,Don't look!

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,robb stark,Renly is not the king.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,robb stark,"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,galbart glover,Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,greatjon umber,"My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,rickard karstark,l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,Because of men like you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,There are no men like me. Only me.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,I hoped the fall would kill him.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lancel lannister,"l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,cersei lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,They have my son.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,l'm told we still have his sisters.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,And do what?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.

Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,l know what a Hand needs.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,Ghost?

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grenn,"Come on, help me get him up."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,pyp,Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,l belong with my brother.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,But we're your brothers now.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grenn,They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,pyp,Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grenn,But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,l have to.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grenn,You can't. You said the words.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,I don't care about –
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,Hear my words and bear witness to my vow
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,To hell with all of you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,pyp,Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grenn,l am the sword in the darkness –
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam pyp and grenn,"l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,"Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,ros,So what's the thing?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,What thing?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,ros,"About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,What? Things? What?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,ros,"When you started, you… Never mind."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Let me see you out, my dear."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,ros,lt's all right. No need.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"Oh, you can do better than that."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,Playing our roles.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Serving a new King.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,yoren,"You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,arya stark,Arry.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,yoren,"You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,"Watch yourself, midget."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,"He's got a sword, this one."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Maybe he's a little squire.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Let's have a look.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,l could use me a sword like that.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Take it off him.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,"Give it here, midget."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,arya stark,You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,gendry baratheon,"Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,arya stark,lt was a gift.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,gendry baratheon,"lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jeor mormont,Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jeor mormont,l didn't say it was your honor.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jeor mormont,"And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jon snow,No.

The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,rakharo,"ls this your command, Khaleesi?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jorah mormont,Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jorah mormont,Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,"ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
