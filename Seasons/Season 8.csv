2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Look at you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You're a man.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,Almost.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where's Arya?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Lurking somewhere.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,And my lord.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,And my queen. Sorry.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,maester wolkan,"At once, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna mormont,Your Grace.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,A lord? Nothing at all?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's not important.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,Not important? We named you King in the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,King of the North!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever they want.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Sorry 'bout that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Are these the last of the wagons?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Aye.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"All right, let's get it all to the forges."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,My lord. My lady.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,royce,My lady.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,It had its moments.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Apologies for leaving like that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,We both survived.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She did.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,And you believed her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You used to be taller.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,How did you sneak up on me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You still have it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Needle.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Have you ever used it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Once or twice.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Valyrian steel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Jealous?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Too heavy for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Now you're defending her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't forget that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,Good.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Are we in King's Landing?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Mm.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You picked the losing side.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,Horses?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,Two thousand.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,And elephants?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Am I most welcome here?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I was hoping we could talk in private.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,After the war. That was our agreement.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Wars sometimes last years.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,How?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,They were lesser men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,"Archie, was it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,And William.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,Tall handsome William?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,Did you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Nearly killed it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,marei,That's brave.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,That boy Eddie.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,The ginger?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,How does he sleep with no eyelids?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,You're kidding me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Which girl?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,That fucking family.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,I wanted those elephants.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You're insulting my late husband?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Are you offended?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,And the Kingslayer?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Life is boring.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You're not boring, I'll give you that."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Do I please the queen?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,But now I want to be alone.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,We can take our home back.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Daenerys went north.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You're my queen. I go where you command.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,But kill the bastards anyway.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,wolkan,"Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,The Karstarks.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,Can't argue with that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And our queen is grateful.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,They do make a handsome couple.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm not that old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Not as old as him.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What is that?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,Nothing lasts.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,How many today?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dothraki man,Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's the matter?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong with them?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They don't like the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What if he doesn't want me to?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What do I hold onto?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you can.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,No one would find us.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We'd be pretty old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So keep your queen warm.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Don't be afraid.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Gendry?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,He's here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"You're saying you're good, is that it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Leave him be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,I heard you were here. You left me to die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,First I robbed you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, thanks. So have you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"I mean, you look good."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Thanks. So do you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"Stay close to that forge, then."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Is that a command, Lady Stark?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't call me that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"As you wish, milady."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Here's my wish.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What do you need something like this for?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it or not?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,You already have a sword. What's that?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You don't know any other rich girls.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Come in.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,The King in the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I told you we needed allies.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,And a Targaryen queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Do you have any faith in me at all?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You know I do.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"No, she's much prettier."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Oh!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So you're the man?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jorah mormont,"They could, they just wouldn't."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there must be something I could give you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,For what crime?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,And also a sword.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,From the Citadel?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Not Randyll Tarly?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You know him?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your brother stood with your father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Of course.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,What are you doing out here?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,"Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Were you hiding from me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Of course not.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She's good.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Little Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Don't you know?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Know what?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She didn't tell you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Would you have done it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I wasn't a king.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,But you were. You've always been.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you talking about?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Daenerys is our queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She shouldn't be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,That's treason.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,"Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,I've always had blue eyes!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,beric,Did you find anyone?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,The Umber boy.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,beric,It's a message. From the Night King.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,"If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister pledged to send her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She did.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I know my brother-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Like you knew your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,The things we do for love.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,This is about survival.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"You don't know me well, Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You vouch for him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I do.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You would fight beside him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I would.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We need every man we can get.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was a fool.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Not for the first time.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Don't you have something better to do?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You make my weapon yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,It's strong enough.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"No, but-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,But you're a fighter.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I've done my share.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You've fought them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I did. Some of them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,How many?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,A few. That was enough.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are they like?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Bad. Really bad.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Really bad""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I know Death.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,He's got many faces.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I look forward to seeing this one.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,My weapon?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I'll get right on it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm not that person anymore.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No. I'm something else now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not angry at me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,I'm not angry at anyone.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Why didn't you tell them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What about afterwards?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,How do you know there is an afterwards?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Well, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Together again.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And the masses rejoice.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,How do they feel about their new queen?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She's your new queen too.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,And she is? Different?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're sure about her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I am.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She didn't seem sure about you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Hmm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Was she lying about the baby too?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"No, that part is real."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,both,A girl's mouth around-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Your cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,My cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Ser Jaime.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Lady Brienne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,He's come a long way.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, I think you're right."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,What are you doing?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I think you know.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I truly don't.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You want me to insult you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,No!
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I better get back.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Have you done something to offend me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,Many things.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Long ago and long forgiven.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You made the right choice.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,But the mind behind all those words-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,royce,"The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You never should have either.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought he knew his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Families are complicated.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ours certainly have been.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,A sad thing to have in common.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"He loves you, you know that."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That bothers you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"All my life, I've known one goal"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Who was the first?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Someone taller.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I take the Iron Throne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,wolkan,"Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,My queen.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,But why aren't you with her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,"Milord, we're not soldiers."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,Thank you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,"When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,woman,Thank you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,Which way should I go?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,Which way do you want to go?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,All the children will be going below when the time comes.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,"That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,I'm sure a lot of people would.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,"All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,My little crow.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I thought we'd lost you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Almost.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How did you find each other?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,We met up at the Last Hearth.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,The dead got there first.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Umbers?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,Fighting for the Night King now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How long do we have?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,The big woman still here?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,They're coming.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,But there are too many of them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Far too many.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Our enemy doesn't tire.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"So, what can we do?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"Yes, he will."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Why? What does he want?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How will he find you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,His mark is on me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,He always knows where I am.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You want us to use you as bait?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're not leaving you alone out there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Dragonfire will stop him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,I don't know. No one's ever tried.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,We're all going to die.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,But at least we die together.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Let's get some rest.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Your Grace.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Do you need help?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You've had a strange journey.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,Stranger than most.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I'd like to hear about it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,It's a long story.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,Hello.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,"When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,Then I will take you there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Have you told her yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,No.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,And now our watch begins.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Gilly? Little Sam?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,They'll be safe down in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,If you want to join them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,To protect them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,Thenn.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,"Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Now it's just us three.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,"Last man left, burn the rest of us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I wish Father were here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,That would be something to see.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Mm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was speaking in relative terms.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you miss it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Of course I miss it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,The perils of self-betterment.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Oh! My lady.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,"Thank you, milord."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I don't think that's wise.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,The battle might start at any moment.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Half cup.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,All right. Just a bit.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"Well, what do we have here?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Ser Davos, join us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"It could be our last night in this world, you know."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Would you like a drink?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Brought my own.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"They call you ""King Killer."""
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure someone does.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,Maybe I will have that drink.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Guess I've changed.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are you doing up here?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,What's it look like?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"I fought for you, didn't I?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,Was he on your list?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,For a little while.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,That's all right.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,Where are you going?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,That for me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,This'll work.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What did the Red Woman want with you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Why your blood?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Was that your first time?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Your first time with a woman.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Or after?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You don't remember?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Yes, I was."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,One? Two? Twenty?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Well, I didn't keep count."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Yes, you did."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Three.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Arya, I-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,At least we'll die with honor.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I think we might live.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,All without a shred of combat ability.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Women can't be knights.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Why not?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Tradition.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Fuck tradition.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I don't even want to be a knight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'll prove it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,We have all we need to win this war.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,I don't need you to remind me of that.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyann,It's all right. We're done here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I wish you good fortune, cousin."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Thank you, my lady."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,What have you got there?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You still have a family.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I'll see you when it's through.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I hope we win.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,We'd better get some rest.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"No, let's stay a bit longer."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,We're out of wine.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,You'll pray for a quick death.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Mm-mm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Mmm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,"High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,The ones who'd been gone for so very long.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who's that?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,He didn't. He loved her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That's impossible.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I wish it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who told you this?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Bran. He saw it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He saw it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,Form up! Get yourselves back!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,northman,Oi!

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Get down to the crypt!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Just hold.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,man,We'll take him.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,lyanna,"Come on, help the lads!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"Yes, my lady."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,lyanna,"Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Come on.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Close the gate!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,That's it.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,edd,"Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,Do you speak their tongue?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,Tell them to lift their swords.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,Valar morghulis.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,grey worm,Valar dohaeris.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,davos,Open the gate!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Open the gate!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,man,Come. Come on. Easy.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,"There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Cease fire!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,The Night King is coming.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,The dead are already here.

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,I don't know how to use it.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Stick them with the pointy end.

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,edd,"Sam, get up!"

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,grey worm,Light the trench! Light the trench!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Wait!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Light the trench!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,davos,She can't see us.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,davos,Light the trenches!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"With a torch, light the trenches! Right there."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Torch it!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,"Lord of Light, cast your light upon us. Lord of Light, defend us. For the night is dark and full of terrors!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,"Lord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,Clegane.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,woman,You must try not to worry yourself.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,varys,At least we're already in a crypt.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,"If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,varys,And got your face cut in half.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,Maybe we should have stayed married.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,You were the best of them.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,What a terrifying thought.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,It wouldn't work between us.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sansa stark,The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,missandei,"Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,theon greyjoy,They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,bran stark,Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,bran stark,I'm going to go now.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,theon greyjoy,Go where?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,davos,Man the walls!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Man the walls!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Man the wall!

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,lyanna,Get out there! Get moving!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,"Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,brienne,Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,They're against the wall!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Get more men up here!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"Fill the gaps, quickly!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Get in there!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,They're climbing the walls!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Relieve the archers!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Relieve the archers!

2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Move back!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Stand away!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"Go on, go on."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jorah mormont,Go! Go.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Step back.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"All the way, archers!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Hold the wall!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,"The wall, they're coming up!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Draw!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,They're coming up!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jaime lannister,Look out!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,Clegane! Clegane!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,"Clegane! Clegane, we need you!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,You can't give up on us.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sandor clegane,"Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,Tell her that.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Open the door!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,soldier,Open the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sandor clegane,Come on!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,Go!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,beric,Run!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sandor clegane,We've gotta go!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,I know you.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,And I know you.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,You said we'd meet again.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,And here we are. At the end of the world.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,Brown eyes... green eyes... and blue eyes.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,melisandre,What do we say to the God of Death?
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,arya stark,Not today.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,theon greyjoy,Here they come!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,theon greyjoy,"Steady, lads."
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,theon greyjoy,Steady now. Make every shot count.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,man,Over there!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,man,There!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,Get off!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,tyrion lannister,"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!"
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jon snow,Bran!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Go!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,daenerys targaryen,Jorah!
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,bran stark,Theon.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,bran stark,You're a good man.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,bran stark,Thank you.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,jorah mormont,I'm hurt.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,jon snow,We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,To your health.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,Have you seen Arya?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,sandor clegane,"You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,I just want to thank her for-
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,sandor clegane,I'm sure you do.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,"Look, it's not about that."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,sandor clegane,"Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,Gendry.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"That's right, isn't it?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,"Yes, Your Grace."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,You're Robert Baratheon's son.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,"I don't know, Your Grace."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,Does anyone?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,gendry baratheon,I can't be. I'm a bastard.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,"No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,all,To Gendry!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,Lord Gendry!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,Gendry!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,"That's easy, isn't it?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,A fitting reward for a hero.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,sam,"Uh, hold on."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,"Come, my lord."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,daenerys targaryen,See? You're not the only one who's clever.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,woman,I have to go down and get another barrel.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,jaime lannister,"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you had your reasons.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,I did. I do.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,So did you?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,davos,Thank you. I feel much better.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,man,More ale!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran stark,It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran stark,I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,You don't want it.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran stark,I don't really want anymore.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,tyrion lannister,I envy you.
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,bran stark,You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Come in.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,And?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Nothing?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,She won't eat.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We'll try again at supper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,I think they're watching me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Who?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,Her soldiers.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Of course they are. That's their job.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"What have I told you, Martha?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,"The greater the risk, the greater the reward."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,The Northern armies?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She shouldn't be alone.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Aren't you worried for her?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We both know what she's about to do.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,What do you want?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,I don't want it. I never have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She is my queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,There's something you need to know.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,He does.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,And Varys?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was a mistake.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She trusts me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,But it doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,I love you. And you will always be my queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"All right, then."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Let it be fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I beg you, my queen-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Let them pass.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Through the gate.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Get going.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She wants to attack now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Daybreak at the earliest.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Careful with that.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,My lord.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,He's always better when he's got some food in him.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Ay up. Where you going?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,I need to go talk to my captain.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Go ahead, talk to him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Where's he going?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to see the ...
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,We speak the common tongue.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,We have orders to guard the prisoner.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,No.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,How did they find you?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Did you consider taking it off?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You've underestimated her before.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Difficult to do from here.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Why?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Swear to me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,I'll try.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You would have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Eyes on the horizon!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Load the scorpion!

2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Make way for the Golden Company!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Close the gate!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,"Move along now, lads."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,That's it.

2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,Quickly. Quickly.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Stop!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,"Get off me! Get off, bitch!"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,woman,"No, get off! Help! Help! No!"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,lannister soldier,Go! Go!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Find somewhere to hide.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,man,My God!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,The Kingslayer.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Well, maybe for you."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You're no king.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,"Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win, I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,qyburn,"Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,qyburn,The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,qyburn,Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,You fought well for a cripple.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,Another king for you.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,But I got you!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,I got you!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,euron greyjoy,I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,I'm going to kill her.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,It's all I care about. And look at me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,Look at me! You wanna be like me?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"You come with me, you die here."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Sandor.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Thank you.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,Your Grace.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Hello, big brother."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,"Ser Gregor, stay by my side."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,"Ser Gregor, I command you."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,qyburn,"Obey your queen, Ser Gregor."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,You're hurt.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,It doesn't matter.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,You're bleeding.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,owen,Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Let go.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,owen,Have you seen my wife?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,man,Out of the way!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,man,No!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,Oh.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,nora,Take my hand. Take my hand! Get up. Get up.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,nora,No. No.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Wait! Wait! No!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,Fucking die!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Fall back!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,woman,We can't go out there.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,You have to.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,woman,Everyone out there is dead.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,"If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Follow me!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,man,"Come on, quickly. All of you."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,vicky,Mama! Mama! Mama!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,vicky,No. Mama! Mama! Mama!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Get up. Get up!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,We have to keep moving.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,nora,Take her. Take her!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,nora,Take her.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,Come on! Come on!
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,This way.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,"Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,It's all right.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,Please don't let me die.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,I don't want to die.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Just look- Look at me. Look at me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,cersei lannister,Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'll find you later.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'm going alone.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Grey Worm!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It's over.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,They are breathing.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Look around you, friend. We won."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,And what are the queen's commands?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Jon. We should speak with the queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Blood of my blood.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Torgo Nudho.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Will you break the wheel with me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Take him.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What are you doing here?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Hey, what happened?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She's everyone's queen now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Try telling Sansa.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Did you bring any wine?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,No.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,So is there life after death?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Not that I've seen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You didn't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Cersei left her no choice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And she burned down a city for it.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Would you have done it?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't know.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What's it matter what I'd do?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Love is the death of duty.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You just came up with that?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,That's her decision. She is the queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I'm sorry it came to this.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She doesn't get to choose.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,It was necessary.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,And Tyrion?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Forgive him.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Please, Dany."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You do. You do. You've always known.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,They don't get to choose.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You are my queen. Now, and always."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Where's Jon?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,He is our prisoner.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,You swore to follow a tyrant.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,"She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's not for you to decide.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,We don't have a king or queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"Make your choice, then."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Uncle? Please sit.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,"Well, we have to choose someone."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Why just us?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yohn royce,I'll ask my horse.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,I suppose you want the crown.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Me? The Imp?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Who, then?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,Why do you think I came all this way?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,riverlands lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yohn royce,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,robin,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,dornish prince,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,ironborn lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,vale lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,gendry baratheon,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,all,All hail Bran the Broken!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,"Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,And I don't want to be king.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,I choose you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,You cannot.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,"Yes, I can. I'm king."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,It is not enough.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,There's still a Night's Watch?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Was it right? What I did?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,What we did.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It doesn't feel right.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Ask me again in ten years.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,unsullied captain,All the men have boarded.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"The North is free, thanks to you."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,But they lost their king.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I can't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I'm not going back north.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Where are you going?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,What's west of Westeros?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You have your Needle?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Right here.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,That's not- Uh-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,What's this?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,He's not kind?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,He-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,He what? What does he say about me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,And Drogon? Any word?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The farther away, the better."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"As you wish, Your Grace."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Ser Podrick.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,That will improve.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,I'm sure it will.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"In full, my lord Hand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Indeed we can.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Any more.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,You Master of Grammar now too?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,The strong live and the weak don't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Find the best builders and set them to the task.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,man,The Queen in the North!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,all,The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!
