2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder frey,"I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,waldery frey,Stand together!
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,all,Stand together!
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,"Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,"Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,"No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,walder,Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,edd,You wildlings?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,meera,"I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,edd,How do I know that's true?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,bran stark,You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,edd,"Okay, come on. Let's get them inside."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,robett,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Not just the boys.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,robett,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,"I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,robett,"Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,lyanna,"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,But if we're going to survive this winter together...
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,You want us to man the castles for you?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,yohn,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,all,Aye!
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,And then they broke faith.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Ned Umber.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Alys Karstark.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Stand.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,ned alys,Now and always!
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Will you start wearing a crown?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Of course you can, but--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're good at this, you know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,At what?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,At ruling.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Why are you laughing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,He never said that to me.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I'm not trying to undermine you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Would that be so terrible?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,wolkan,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,What does she want?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,You almost sound as if you admire her.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I learned a great deal from her.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,What is this?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"No, not angry."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Are you afraid of me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Should I be?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Dragonstone.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the east.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"A dynasty for us, then."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,We never talked about Tommen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,There's nothing to say.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Our baby boy killed himself.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Cersei--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Not all of them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Well, it looks like all of them."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,A queen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,If not the most humble.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,What do you want in return?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I decline your proposal.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,Why?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Weigh that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,What's the weight?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Um, 147."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,I don't remember your proposition.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Sources in the restricted area?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"So, you believe me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Be a good lad. Clean this up.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,Nope.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,You're a lucky man.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,My lady.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,Why is he still here?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,He wants something.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I know exactly what he wants.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,It's a new one.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,I don't want to steal your food.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,You heading south?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,King's Landing.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Poor girl.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"Not so bad, is it?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Worst place in the world.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,What are you doing in the Riverlands?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Here you go. Guests first.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,My wife's just had our first baby.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,Boy or girl?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,I hope it's a girl.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,Why?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Are you old enough to drink?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,It's really good.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,I'm going to kill the queen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Bad night to be outdoors.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Why are you always in such a foul mood?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Experience.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,This seems like a good place to spend the night.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,These people don't want us here.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I don't like the look of it.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,They don't.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,How do you think it ended for them?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,With death.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Doesn't matter now.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"No, doesn't matter now."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,But there's nothing special about you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,You're right about that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,And?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Your Lord.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Clegane.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,What do you want?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Look into the flames.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I don't want to look in the damn flames.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,What do you see?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Logs burning.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Keep looking. What do you see?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,What else?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Thousands of them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Burying the dead.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,You knew these people.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Not really.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,little sam,Mom.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,"You should really sleep, Sam."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,The dead don't.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,Legends of the Long Night.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,What is it?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,That's dragonglass?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah mormont,Has she come yet?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Who?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah mormont,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Haven't heard anything.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,daenerys targaryen,Shall we begin?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could remember it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Not so many lions.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I never properly thanked you for that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I did.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,Which you turned to your advantage.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who gave the order to kill me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,King Robert.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who hired the assassins?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,To keep yourself alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I swear it, my queen."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,"Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,I am called Melisandre.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"No, it didn't."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,What does your Lord expect from me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"No, but I like it better."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You know him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,He sounds like quite a man.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Read the last bit.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"No, too dangerous."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,But?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Lord Tarley.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,dickon,"Ser, Jaime."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"Rickon, isn't it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,dickon,Dickon.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,That's it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,How long?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,But how long 'till...
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Does this look like a baby to you?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"Come, Samwell."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Mormont?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,You are.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Do I have your support?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,You have mine.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Enter.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,I will see you when I return.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,But you don't know when that will be.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,No one knows.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I wish you good fortune.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Missandei --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,Why?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,You know why.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I don't.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,You are my weakness.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,That's what I am? Your weakness?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I believe it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I do too.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I want to see you. Please.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,And this one.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I wanted to ask you --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"We're not poets, Tarley."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,This is your moment. Use it wisely.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Oh, you are?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Oh.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Hello.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What are you doing?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Drink this.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What is it?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,If you could take off your shirt.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Have you ever done this before?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,"If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,As long as we get back there before they start.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,One more round. It's a long ride.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Ary!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Mmm. This is good.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,I didn't do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,You've been making pies?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,One or two.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Big lady?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,She found me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,What happened to you Ary?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,You got any ale?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Where are you heading?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,King's Landing.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Why?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,I heard Cersei's queen now.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Hmm.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I can't believe someone could do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Cersei would do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,No. The Boltons are dead.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,You're lying.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks for the pie.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,"No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Come in.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,wolkan,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I know that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yohn royce,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,robett glover,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lyanna mormont,"Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I'm leaving both in good hands.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Whose?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,You don't belong down here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I have nothing to say to you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Nymeria?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Come with me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,That's not you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,You can't have them all. It's not fair.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,I'm oldest.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,"Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,A few times. Never stayed long.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,A boy in every port?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Could we get some more?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,I thought it wasn't for you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,I'm developing a taste for it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He's not your servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon greyjoy,It's fine.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Once I kill my uncle.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"And what will you be, handsome?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon greyjoy,Whatever my queen demands.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"Oh, I see. Your protector."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,So if someone gets too close to you --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He might have to intervene.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,hold that person back.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Until they've made their intentions known.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Stay here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Euron.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Kill us! Get it over with!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,Give your uncle a kiss.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,Theon!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,"Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her."

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The bastard of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Davos Seaworth.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,and DAVOS shake hands.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Unluckily for me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Of course.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"Please, this way."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,I was born on the Island of Naarth.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,This place has changed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Does she miss me terribly?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I didn't ask --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She's starting to let on.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,True. But I'm not a Stark.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Why?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,So where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,Volantis.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"I will return, dear spider. One last time."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,My Lady --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,This is Jon Snow.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,He's King in the North.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Forgive me --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Forever.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Then why are you here?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,They're hard to miss.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"But still, I need your help?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Almost.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You told me you liked this man.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,The dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Is that another figure of speech?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The Army of the Dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,we're finished.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,And why would I do that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Am I your prisoner?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,All of them?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,Your sister's dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon greyjoy,Euron has her.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,You saw him take her? And you got away?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon greyjoy,I couldn't save her. I tried.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,You wouldn't be here if you tried.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Oh no!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,What a twat.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,I give you --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,A bit more than a true friend.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,There's only one reward I want.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,when the war is won.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Advice?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyene,Momma!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,The Long Farewell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's the one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,How long does the poison take?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,But death is certain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,No.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"At once, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"No, thank you."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Your father's daughter indeed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You probably don't believe me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do actually.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good question.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,What do you mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Which wise man said this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I don't remember.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Amazing thing to see.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,He is my Hand.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,He enjoys talking.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I never expected that you would.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I haven't either.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How much do we have?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What does that mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"Very wise, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"No, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,So they should be.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I only meant to say --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,guard,"Lady Sansa, at the gate."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,"Hello, Sansa."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I wish Jon was here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,Yes. I need to speak to him.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I don't know what that means.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,It's difficult to explain.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Try, please, for me."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,"It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How do you know all of this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,The three-eyed raven taught me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I told you it's difficult to explain.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Bran --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I'll stay a bit longer.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Hmm.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Hmm. Does it hurt?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,A bit. Less than before.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,The infection no longer appears to be active.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,And the climate.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,How bad is it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I owe my life to her and you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I hope they do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,You treated him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Yes.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Who told you to treat him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,No one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I seem to remember you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,But you treated him anyway?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I read the books and followed the instructions.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,"Thank you, Archmaester."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Come here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,And what will they face?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,They will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,man,Draw! Loose!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,unsullied,There are none left.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey worm,There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey worm,Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It's done?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,It is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Widow's Wail.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"Yes, it has."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,I think we're done here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,How will it happen?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Will there be pain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,No. I made sure of that.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,That's good.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."

2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is no more High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is still the question of my prize.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,It's not a castle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,How about that one? It's available.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,You don't want Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I beg to differ.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Right. Just not to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Stranger things have happened.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Like what?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,The current harvest?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,My Lord.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,My Lord.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,This is for you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Do you know who this belonged to?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Chaos is a ladder.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,stands up to leave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I'm not Lord Stark.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,What's that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,It's a very good idea.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,You're leaving?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"No, I don't."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,That's all you've got to say?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Thank you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,Thank you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,For helping me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,begins to cry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,You died in that cave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,"turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Hey, oh. Where are you going?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,In there. I live here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Fuck off.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Arya Stark is dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,There's no Rodrick here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Maester's name is Wolkan.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,He's a thousand miles away.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Mm-hmm.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Which Lady Stark?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You sit there. Right there. Don't move.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You tell her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,I'm not.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sighs.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,hesitates for a moment.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,smirks at ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,We're not.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to face SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,I wish I had.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Of people I'm going to kill.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"No, they're not."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"Arya, Bran's home too."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,You came home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I saw you at the crossroads.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,You saw me?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I see quite a lot now.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Bran has visions.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,So did I.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would you go back there?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Cersei is on her list of names.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Who else is on your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Most of them are dead already.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Where did you get this?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Littlefinger gave it to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's declared for House Stark.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would he give you a dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,He thought I'd want it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Because it was meant to kill me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,The cutthroat after your fall?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,It doesn't matter.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I don't want it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,It's wasted on a cripple.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I did next to nothing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,"You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I'm not a --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,pauses for a moment.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"Thank you, Podrick."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,He better.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What happened?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,begins smirking.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,Many things.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Many things?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Your Grace.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,It's all right.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The Children of the Forest made these.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,When?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,A very long time ago.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,No.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"No, I don't think I can."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We took Casterly Rock.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,That's very good to hear.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Isn't it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We still have the largest army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We've discussed this.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,A smart one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks over to JON SNOW.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What do you think I should do?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I would never presume to --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I'm at war. I'm losing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins walking close to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,glances back towards the dragons.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Don't lunge.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Up.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,And don't --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's been awhile since I've trained.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,chuckles.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,nods her head in agreement.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"Move aside, Podrick."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,"backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I'll try not to.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Who taught you to do that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,No one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,What do you think of her?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Who?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,sighs
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,I believe you know of whom I speak.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I think she has a good heart.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Fewer.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,It doesn't matter.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Of course.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Is the custom different in Naarth?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,The sounds liberating.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Why did you leave your homeland?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,I was stolen away by slavers.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm sorry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,She bought me from my master and set me free.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,You believe that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Jon. I didn't know you were here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,steps closer to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,"Sansa, is she all right?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,releases THEON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,I should be.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Your sister?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The queen is gone.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Where did she go?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Good.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We are stretched a bit thin.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"is clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."

2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,nods his head in agreement.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,And?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,It was glorious.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on. Your father's not here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over at BRONN
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Listen.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,In line now!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,draws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,Spears armed!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Get back to King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'm not abandoning my army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We can hold them off.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Hold the line!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Archers! Archers with me!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Knock!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,archers,Knock! Draw!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Loose!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Go get it then.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I can't shoot with one hand.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Come on!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Where are you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,guard,Your people can't fight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Take cover!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on you fucker.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,"Flee, you idiot!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Come on, boy. Come on!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,You fucking idiot.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,end,CREDITS
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You could have killed me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,What the fuck were you doing back there?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Ending the war by killing her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You saw the dragon between you and her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,looks incredulously at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You're fucked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't you mean we're fucked?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I have to tell Cersei.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,pauses and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,Best well jump back in that river.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Step forward, My Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not kneel?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,I already have a queen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,"There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,You will have to kill me too.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,Step back and shut your mouth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,A stupid boy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,I will not.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm not beheading anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Your Grace --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,drogon,draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,My Lord.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,How many men did we lose?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We haven't done a full counting.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,turns and walks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,He didn't.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,After all this time it still amazes me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,After.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And you believed her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"looks away, then sits down."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You weren't gone long.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns back to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and doesn't say anything.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You're not sure how you feel about that?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"No, I'm not."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Thousands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,So it was a figure of speech?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,He is my friend.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,kneels before DAENERYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Your Grace.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,stands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I served with your father. He was a great man.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,nods to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You look strong. You found a cure?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,It would be my honor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,steps forward and hugs JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran stark,s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran stark,Ravens. We need to send ravens.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,nods his head to BRAN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,archmaester,MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,stops working and turns around.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Brandon Stark --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,the crippled boy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,Do you know him?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,steps forward and clears his throat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Archmaester --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,"That will be all, Tarley."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I'm afraid so.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Horrible business.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys is not her father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Who is that for?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Jon Snow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Did you read it?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What's it say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Nothing good.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,interrupts VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I need to go home.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You said you don't have enough men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking around the table closer to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,So bring the dead to her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Is that possible?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And how would you get into King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,nods his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,They won't have to.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I haven't given you permission to leave.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,robett,"The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,yohn,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,These are mother and father's chambers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Don't do that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns around to face ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,What?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Say what you mean.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Are you angry with me?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Their opinions are important to you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Not if they lose their heads first.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I have work to do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns and walks away from ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,My lady.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,exits the room.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You're not staying here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What if someone takes the boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And here I am ready to train.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why down here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I'll leave you to it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,remains silent and stares at TYRION.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't talk about our father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Listen to me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,What do you want?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I thought you might still be rowing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Anybody give you any trouble?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,nods.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I think you need to understand --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I'm ready. Let's go.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You should know what you're heading into.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You might want to bring one of those swords.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,this I know.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Who should I say I am?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,You there.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Is that your boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,It is.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,The docks are that way.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Still five gold dragons?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Are you joking?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,You must be even older than you look. 15.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,15?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Apiece.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,turns and begins walking back to his boat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,What's in the boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,pauses and turns back to the guards.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Not more gold.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Wine?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Mmm.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,I like wine.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Or hams.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Come and have a look.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Fermented crab.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,What?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"Oi, Dwarf!"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,quickly walks to cut the guards off.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,That dwarf --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Where did you get that scar?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,This is Gendry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,He'll do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,That won't be necessary.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why was QYBURN here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I met with Tyrion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,What did our brother have to say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,To discuss a surrender?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,To discuss an armistice.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Are you going to punish him?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Bronn.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,looks confused.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You let it happen. Why?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Who will you say is the father?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,You.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,People won't like that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Never betray me again.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I understand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You don't have to worry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Understood.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You survived King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Yet again.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Your Grace, this is --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,steps forward in front of DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks to DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He was meant to keep that to himself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I met yours in my shop.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're a lot leaner.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You're a lot shorter.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I grew up on stories about them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Do you know how to use one?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,shakes his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Well, that's a problem."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I prefer a hammer.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,looks to DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He can handle himself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,nods.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We could use the help.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,smiles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,But I've grown used to him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Heave!
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,"15,782."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,looks away and pauses.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,None anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,"That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Steps. That number was steps.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"I found it, my Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,hands BAELISH a raven scroll.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"Yes, my Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,"JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I've been failing at that job of late.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,How many queens are there now?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Two.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Both.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,How many men did you bring?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks around the table.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Not enough.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,The big woman?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,We were hoping some of your men could help.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,nods his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You are.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,turns to look at JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You really want to go out there again?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You're not the only ones.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Thoros?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,sits up from a dark corner.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,I hardly recognized you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,Ser Jorah Mormont --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,He was my father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,He hunted us like animals.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,He's right. We're all on the same side.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,How can we be?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We're all breathing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,end,CREDITS
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Are you all right?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,faces JON and grunts.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Ever been north before?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,Never seen snow before.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You've never been down south.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I've been to Winterfell.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,That's the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,We have to make due with what we've got.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,This one is maybe not so smart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Good. That's more important than being smart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,looks at JON as they continue to walk.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,You sold me to a witch.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,"I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Sounds all right so far.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,and put leeches on me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Was she naked too?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,She needed your blood.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,Yes. Thank you. I know that.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,It could have been worse.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,I'm not whinging.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,motions to BERIC.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,Good lad.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,Your father wanted to execute me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I heard.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,and JON glance at each other.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,Me too.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"pauses, then nods at JON."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He gave it to you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm not his son.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,starts a slow clap.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,turns to look at ARYA.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They forced me to do it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You were there?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I wanted to.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,But you didn't. Just like me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was training.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You never would have survived what I survived.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I guess we'll never know.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I don't know yet.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Arya --
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,turns and walks away.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You're the one they call the dog.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Fuck off.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,looks up at TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Gingers I hate.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I didn't trip. I was pushed.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Ever since you've been mean.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Will you fuck off?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and turns to TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Dick?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Cock.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Ah. Dick. I like it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I bet you do.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and glances at TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Brienne of Tarth.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You know her?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,nods.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You do know her.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,We've met.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,and TORMUND begin walking.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I'm good at killing people.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,You don't much look like him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Who's that?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You knew him?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I serve the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,He wants you alive.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Why?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,I don't know.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,So what are you fighting for?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But we all die.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,That's what I saw in the fire.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,points towards the mountain.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,A mountain like an arrowhead.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,Are you sure?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,turns to THOROS and nods his head.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,We're getting close.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I honestly don't.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,You're not a hero.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Oil?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"Pitch, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,How many barrels?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"500, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Get 500 more.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"Yes, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The thrill will fade.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Gold?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yet, your brother--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"Archers, stand tall!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,Cover that wall!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,How many people live here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A million, give or take."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why isn't she with them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And the rest of them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Including our brother.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"Yes, Your Grace."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,missandei,Why did they build it?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah mormont,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,Maybe it still is.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,Hard to blame you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Cersei will anyway.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,I'm glad you're alive.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,What's in there?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Fuck off.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,I thought you were dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Not yet. You came pretty close.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,I was only trying to protect her.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,You and me both.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,She's alive. Arya.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Where?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,Winterfell.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Who's protecting her if you're here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,It won't be me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"It is, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I'm sure your new queen--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,It's good to see you again.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yeah, you, too."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You might.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Where is she?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll be here soon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Didn't travel with you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,We've been here for some time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,My apologies.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We are all facing a unique
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Theon! I have your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Why?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Sit down or leave.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We all know that will never happen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then why are we here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Yes. That's all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We can destroy them by burning them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,How many?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Can they swim?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What are you talking about?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"In return, the King"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Just the King
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Fuck loyalty?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And tell her what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,I wish you hadn't done that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I know!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I did this. I should go.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You spoke with her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I didn't know about that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,the destruction of this family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You killed our father
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I have never been more sorry about anything.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I will not hear it, not from you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not hear it!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Mm, not like this."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You're pregnant.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No one is less happy about this than I am.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't have children.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Who told you that?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,The witch who murdered my husband.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, what now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You think he wants to marry her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,She's your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Why did she come to Winterfell?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Lady
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah mormont,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Jon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Can I speak with you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,All right.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No. Not compared to you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Our father was more of a father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,He was.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I did.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,But the things I've done.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Your sister--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,She's not dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,She's our queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,She's your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I did. I ran from my uncle.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,We're done with all that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Who says we are?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,He needs to shut his mouth.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,Hey!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"Oh, yes!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,That's more like it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Stay down or I'll kill you!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,I said stay down or I'll kill you!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Not for me. For Yara!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,men,Yara!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Have my sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,Are you sure you want to do this?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,And what does honor demand?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,"All right, then. Get on with it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,My sister asked you a question.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I did it to protect you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Whatever your aunt
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I know of no such letter.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,You held a knife to his throat.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,You told our mother
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Sansa, please."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,john royce,I think not.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I loved you. More than anyone.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Sansa! I--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Your Grace.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,men,Your Grace.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Preparing the expedition north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I made a promise.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Our child will rule Westeros.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And then what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And then we rule.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Two.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What happened to the third?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I didn't conspire with him.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And that will be treason.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Treason?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Disobeying your queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I told you no one walks away from me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,There's one more yet to come.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Give the order, then."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I don't believe you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,Come in.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,Samwell Tarly.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,I remember everything.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,Oh! I don't know what that means.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,Oh.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,He needs to know the truth.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,The truth about what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,It's not.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,Dornish bastards are named Sand.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,Are you certain?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,rhaegar,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,lyanna,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,He loved her. And she loved him.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,And Jon - Jon's real name.

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brans voice,He needs to know. We need to tell him.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,Are you all right?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Does that bother you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
