2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Magnificent.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Looks fresh-forged.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,It is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,From someone who no longer had need of it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,And now we have two.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Two?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll have to train your left hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll never be as good.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Home?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,No?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I don't believe I asked you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's my answer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,What do you want?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Supper would be nice.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I suppose you want the sword back.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Keep it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Please don't.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Oh.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Ah, here we are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Can you read the sigils?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Yellow balls?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,I need a sigil.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"I don't see it, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,Will he?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,And where is Prince Oberyn?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,"Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,You must be weary after such a long journey.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Look at this one. How lovely is she?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Beautiful. But pale.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You like?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Timid. Timid bores me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're not timid, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Not timid.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you like women?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,whore,"When they look like her, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,This one will do nicely.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"Very good, my lady."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Oh, I'm not a lady."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,A term of courtesy in this establishment.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Any of the others?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,The two girls can leave.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You stay.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,My lord.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Take off your clothes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Which way do you like it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,My way .
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Oberyn.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,Weep o'er his hall...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Oberyn, don't."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgans friend,"You lost, friend?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgans friend,I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,We don't like the smell.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Come with me, lover."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"Gods, look at this one."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,trouble.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Apologies, my love."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,What are you? His hired killer?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,How did that come to pass?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, they take all kinds."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Even Dornishmen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I was invited to the royal wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I thought we were speaking truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't actually present.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I'm asking you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I've heard rumors.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Ser Barristan.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,"Gambling, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Gambling?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,crowd,Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,How long have they been at it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"Since midnight, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,grey worm,"You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,I'd rather have no brains and two balls.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You need to eat something.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Pigeon pie.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"No, thank you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Lemon cakes?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You love lemon cakes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Tell her she needs to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, you do need to eat."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't need to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,She needs to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I can't let you starve.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I swore to protect you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,How can you help me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"I don't know, but I can try."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,My lion.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I haven't forgotten.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,I want you. Don't you want me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Things are a bit tense right now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What things?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You need to relax.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Don't you want to relax?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What's wrong?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I told you. It's not a good time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Do you love her?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,That's not an answer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I don't love her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You tried to ship me away.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Ship you away?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What in the world are you talking about?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,"If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You want me to stay?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,"A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Days?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Uh... a hook would be more practical.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Elegant, I think."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Thank you for your help with the other matter.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,The symptoms have abated?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,"Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Odd little man.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What symptoms?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Symptoms that are not your concern.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You let him touch you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You jealous?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You drink more than you used to.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Yes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,It must have been traumatic for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,A rather short siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Father disowned me today.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You're forgetting Tyrion.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Not now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Something's changed.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to apologize for?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,For leaving me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I... What are you saying?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,I'm saying you took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Come in.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Go away.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,marei,"Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,We wait for Mance's orders.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"Yeah, well, he's a liar."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I did.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Mance sent you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,How did you find us?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"You came from the south, not the north."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,warg,Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Help yourself.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,She yours?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I'm not anybody's.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,officer,Draw. Loose.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,Sometimes I want to hate you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,They're... they're ready for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I've done plenty wrong.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I didn't murder him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He wanted me to kill him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I do.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,The law is the law. The boy must die.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,Giants?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slunt,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,How dare you?!
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,"I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"Yes, you are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,And I don't trust the bastard.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,He told the truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,I grew up in King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Nonsense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,My word.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,You dare not refuse.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,A shadow?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Joffrey is our king now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,I meant no offense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,And you've given none.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,"Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,meryn,"I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,meryn,The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,"I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Busy getting captured.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,So they say.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Ser Jaime Lannister.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's still time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever been to Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,A dusk rose.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,And this one's called lady's lace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk without shoes?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,There she is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Yes, there she is."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,And? You made a promise.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,To keep them safe.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,A complication does not release you from a vow.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,You're drunk.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Anyone would have done the same.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,Yeah.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,The little lady wants a pony.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,The little lady wants away from your stench.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,No.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're not very smart, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'm not a thief.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,A man's got to have a code.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,I'm hungry. You're hungry.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He killed Lommy.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,What the fuck's a Lommy?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Got what?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,My sword Needle.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Needle? Of course you named your sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Lots of people name their swords.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Lots of cunts.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,What are you... get back here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,My brother gave me that sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Get back here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He killed my friend.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,"Come on, give it up."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Come here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Let's have a feel there.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Leave it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,innkeeper,"Please, she's a good girl."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,I know you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You're the Hound.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Just keeping the king's peace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,No need. The war's over.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,None taken.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,She's all right. I've had better.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'm not going to King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Fuck the king.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You got money to pay for it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,You paid for it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Not a penny.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'll still take that chicken.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You don't seem to understand the situation.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Someone is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,What? What do you mean?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Carry me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Fine little blade.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,There you are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,"I can't see her, Ramsay."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,Where is she?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,I only wounded her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"A fine shot, master. My lady."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"Please, my lord. It hurts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,Why? I did whatever you asked.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,Me jealous of her?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"My lord, please."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Not so pretty now.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,Is it solid gold?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Gilded steel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Oh!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,I'll clean it up.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"No, I'll do it. Leave us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,It's only wine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I can't fight anymore.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,What about your left?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Is this place safe?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Uh-huh.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Best time to attack a man.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Plan on growing it back?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Come on, then."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Open the gates!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father. Welcome home.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"A pleasure, Mother."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,walda,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,woman,"This way, my lady."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,Where is your prize?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,What did you do to him?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You flayed him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,I placed far too much trust in you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Give him the razor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"I don't know, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,And crisped them so no one would know.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You ready for a hunt?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meryn trant,Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Oh, to be foreign."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Ahem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,"From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,"I shall be honored, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A book?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,So they say.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Stormbringer.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Terminus.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Widow's Wail.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Wolfsbane.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,"You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't call me that.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What should I call you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,Our friendship?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What is this?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,She doesn't want you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need to do right by her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,You don't want her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,By our children.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What are you afraid of?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm not afraid.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need you to leave.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,"We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,How many whores have you been with?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,"Sire, I served you well."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, show us the way..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,"Selyse, you're my sister!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Yours are the stars that guide us.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,Tell him! Tell him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,He was an infidel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,A good deal more than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Meat's off.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Our larders are almost empty.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,You hate fish.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Of course I remember.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,It's all I knew when I was a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Until you found the Lord of Light?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Until he found me.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,I fear for our daughter's soul.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,She's a stubborn little beast.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Come in.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,I heard it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,And it frightened you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,But they screamed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,And you didn't have this.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,"I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,hodor,Hodor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,Why did you wake me?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,You've been gone for hours.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I was hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,We're all hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I was just eating.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,"You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,"Hodor, take me to the tree."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,threeeyed raven,Look for me... beneath the tree.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,threeeyed raven,North.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I know where we have to go.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,septon,"Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"With this kiss, I pledge my love."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,sansa stark,We have a new queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Better her than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,It feels proportionate.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Proportionate to what?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,The expected extravagance.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,All taken care of.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw her board the ship?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Aye, she's on it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw the ship sail away?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's someone following you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Not you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,My lady. My lady.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,musician,"A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Very good. Very good. Off you go.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You're an example to us all.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,"Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,As does yours.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,"Yes, very much."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,They certainly are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,And neither will you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,Your Grace. My king. My queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did you just bow?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Yes, yes."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"As you say, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you love him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,Your Grace.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She'll do no such thing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,maid,Your Grace.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,I never meant to annoy anyone.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,You're in rather a good mood.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I suppose I am.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I won't ask why.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Small pleasures.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ellaria,My lord. My lady.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Charmed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ellaria,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,No? How tolerant of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,I'm the rightful king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,King in the North!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Yes!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,Traitor. You're a traitor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,For the Seven Kingdoms!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Let the war begin.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,"Renly, you're no king."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,"Ooh, careful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,Go on.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the rightful king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Challenge me, ruffian."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,Take that.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the King in the North!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,Not wildfire!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Charge!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,"Ready, again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the King in the North! - Charge!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Charge! Yes!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Your head!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Fine gentlemen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,It did not spill.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Your Grace does me a great honor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,It's not meant as an honor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Bring me my goblet.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Kneel. Kneel before your king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Kneel. I said... kneel!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"Look, the pie."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,My queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,sansa stark,Can we leave now?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Let's find out.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Mm, good. Needs washing down."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"No. No, you'll wait here... un..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,It's nothing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,He's choking!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,Help the poor boy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Idiots, help your king."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Move away!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Help him! Someone help him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ser dontos,Come with me now.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ser dontos,"If you want to live, we have to leave."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Don't touch him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,My son.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,He's gone. Our king is gone.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,You did this. You did this!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,We have to leave.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Take him! Take him!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is she?!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No one leaves the capital! No one!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Get in.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Where are we going?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Somewhere safe.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Lord Baelish?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"10,000."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Wait!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,I didn't murder anyone.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Why did you kill him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He saved me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He was helping me because I saved his life.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,We're all liars here.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,So am I the queen?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,What was it like?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,But I would have been the queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,It means I'll become king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,A good king?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Holiness?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Justice.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,What about strength?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Wisdom.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Wisdom is what makes a good king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,A king needs a queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Yes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,How are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,I'm all right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,septon,"Yes, my lord. All of you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't know what I saw.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,It's not right. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't care.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Don't.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You think? You don't have a map?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"No, I don't have a map."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Maybe we should get one.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,How far is it to the Eyrie?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Far.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,And you're sure we're going the right way?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,On your way where?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Why Braavos?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I have friends there.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I doubt it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Seven blessings to you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,What do you want?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,What do I want? This is my land.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,He's never been the same.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Which house did he fight for?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,The Tullys of Riverrun.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Father!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I'm so sorry.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Really good.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Did you fight at the Twins?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Guest right don't mean much anymore.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,You got any ale?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Afraid not.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Fair wages for fair work.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,What did you do?!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Get your horse saddled.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You told me you weren't a thief.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I wasn't.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,He took us in. He fed us and you...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You don't know that.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ranger,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"There he is, Sam the Slayer."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,janos slynt,Going to visit your wildling whore?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,She's not a whore.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,janos slynt,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,They all think I'm lying.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,About what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Killing the white Walker.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,A what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"Well, a wildling."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,My father hated that word.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Why do you worry about it?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"100 men, one woman."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,They've got other things to think about.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,That's the only thing they think about.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You're being silly.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,What about you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Thank you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,For what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,For worrying about me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,So what are you saying?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Are you bored of me?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Your Grace.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Joffrey?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,What progress have you made?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Peasebury.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,House Musgood.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Musgood.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,And House Haigh.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,The Golden Company?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,They've never broken a contract.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,They're sellswords.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,We don't have any gold.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Not yet.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You're late.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"I'm sorry, Princess."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,I thought you weren't coming.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,"You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Thank you very much.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,What's the difference?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,My father says a criminal is a criminal.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You've sailed to Braavos?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,What was that for?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I need you to write a message.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,But that's not you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Precious little thing.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,What's his name?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Sam.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Lovely. That the daddy?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Where's the daddy?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,He's dead.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Oh. Where you from?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,North of here.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,North of here? You a fucking wildling?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,Only room and board?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,"Could find other work for her, too."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,No other work.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You protected me north of the Wall.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Best for you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Greedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,No?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Your loss.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Does that surprise you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,Everyone has a preference.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"What are you, 25?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,Children.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,Did you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,They will all have to line up behind you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Lord Tywin.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,May we have the room?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Would you like to sit?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No, thank you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some wine?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I'm sorry about your grandson.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Which way is that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Some believe the king choked.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I did. This is why I know.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You think we conspired together?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,The death of my sister.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,For which you blame me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Categorically.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I could arrange for this meeting.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,But you want something in return.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Why?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,A noble effort.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Your father.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Mace Tyrell.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"My lord, she's gone."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Gone?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,They'll be following you now.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Who will?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I'll ask, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Are you going to accept their offer?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,My lord.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"You've been good to me, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Farewell, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Mother says it's time to eat.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,guymon,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Potatoes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,guymon,"Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,man,The wildlings!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ollys mother,Guymon! Hide. Hide!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,styr,You know how to get to Castle Black?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Yes. Yes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,styr,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,yarwyck,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,men,Aye! Aye!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,yarwyck,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,men,Aye!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,maester aemon,We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,There's got to be a way to protect them.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,Rangers returning.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,Help him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,What took you so long?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grenn,We were held up.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,By what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grenn,Chains.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,And the mutineers stayed?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,We need to ride north and kill them all.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Are they attacking?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,What is he doing?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,I believe he means to...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,missandei,"He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grey worm,"Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Which is why you must remain by my side.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,"I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,missandei,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You sure you don't want a horse?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,Why would I want a horse?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Horses are faster than men.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,Horses are dumber than men.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Fire!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,Isles. Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,I am from an island called Naath.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,When they took you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,"When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,You remember your home?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,I don't want return.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,Kill the masters.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,Kill the masters.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,How are the lessons coming?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,"Very well, Your Grace."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,You heard her! She said she came to free us.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meereen slave,I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,"I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,All men must die.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,Who are you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meereen slave,"We have no training, weapons."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jorah mormont,"163, Khaleesi."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, that was it."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,barristan selmy,"Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,I will answer injustice with justice.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What the hell was that?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You talk to my brother this way?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,All the time. He got used to it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Do you think he did it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,We're done for today.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Her son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Don't. You know what's coming?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Depends. Did you do it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Well, you could set me free."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know I can't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Then there's really nothing else to say.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Except I didn't do it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Where are you taking me?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Did you kill Joffrey?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I know it was you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Why not?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Then perhaps it was your husband.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,No.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,How do you know?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I just do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,And what do you want?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Who could trust you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,How absentminded of me.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Well, he could have done."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"He could have done,but he didn't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"You don't know, Grandmother."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,What? I don't understand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Bring it through! And again.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Very nice. Good.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Let's see what you can do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Olly, you just watch for now."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,I can fight.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,I was!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grenn,"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Grenn and I were helping them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorn,"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Someone has to train them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,Get back to work. Now! I said now!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos slynt,The bastardo s well-liked.You're not.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos slynt,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Name's Locke.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You fight well.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,"Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Guess I was wrong.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,She hoped or did you promise?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,And?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Ser Pounce?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Yes. But if my mother found out...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Yes? Tell me a secret.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,That's Ser Pounce.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Very handsome.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,No. I don't think I am.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Remember, our little secret."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,Valyrian steel.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Mmm. It's yours.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I can't accept this.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I hope I got your measurements right.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I don't need a squire.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Of course you do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,He'll slow me down.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,podrick,"I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,Oathkeeper.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Good-bye, Brienne."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,podrick,"Come on, move."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I should neverhave taken her away.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,She wasn't safe here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Castle Black could be next.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I should go back for Gilly.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,"Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Ahem, brothers."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, brothers."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,woman,"No, don't. Don't, please."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,woman,Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Rast.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Go outside and feed the beast.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,rast,We should kill that thing.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,women,A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,What the fuck is that?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sissy,Craster's last child. A boy.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sissy,He didn't kill them. He offered them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,To who?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sissy,To the gods. The white walkers.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,women,A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Shut up!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Rast is headed that way.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,rast,Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,rast,Fuck!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,hodor,Hodor.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,Do you hear that?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,Is that a baby?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jojen,It's coming.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,I'm going out there.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"No, we need to stay together."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,I'm going.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jojen,Bran. Bran.

2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"Bran, what happened?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,"Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,Who?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,"I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,No.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"Bran, we need to go now."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,I'm not leaving without Summer.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,Can you remember where the cage was?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bran stark,The east side of the keep.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet..."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,rast,"If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Help him up.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,rast,What the fuck's wrong with him?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Come here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,"No, please. Please.Please, let me help him."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Who are you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meera,Please.

In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!"

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He sits the throne like he was born to it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"No, he wasn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You still mourn for Joffrey?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He was my husband. My king.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He would have been your nightmare.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I feel..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He has you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Who told you to take the Navy?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,No one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,So why did you do it?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,I heard you liked ships.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many ships?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"Ninety-three, Your Grace."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many men can they carry?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,The Lannisters have more.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"What, then?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I will do what queens do. I will rule.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,But how would they know?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Stand to.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Stand to!
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,"Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Uncle Petyr!
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lord.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Oh. I have brought you a gift.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Lord Baelish.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lady.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,My flesh and blood.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Of course. I understand.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,I would never say a thing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"They did, and my father's."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,"They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Make him fly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Through the Moon Door.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No. We never...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Go. We'll speak soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,What took you so long?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Let's get married tonight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,I do think that we could wait until...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Like it was yesterday.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Tonight it is, then."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A fortnight?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That seems reasonable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,And your wedding to Loras?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Shortly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,A fortnight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,We had that in common.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then whom can we trust?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Ourselves alone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Haven't a clue.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"Go on, your best guess."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That can't be.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,How much?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A tremendous amount.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Would you shut up?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,I can't sleep until I say the names.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,"If he were here right now, what would you do?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,I'm almost done. Only one name left.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Go on.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,The Hound.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Thank you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Really?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Yes. I'm very lucky.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,He feels responsible for you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Loved your mother.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,That's what you wanted to say.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"No, never."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Are you pregnant?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your young, pretty body."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Nothing. I'm a virgin.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Don't lie to me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,You're hurting me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I'll know if you lie.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,That's a long way off.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"All knights have squires, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"I swore an oath, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I know.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What do you think will happen if you leave?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,The hell you doing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Practicing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"What, ways to die?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,No one's going to kill me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,What do you know about anything?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,It was not.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Was? He dead?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Yes.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,How?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,He was killed.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Who by?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,He was outnumbered.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Your Grace.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"A poem, actually."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,May I show you the gardens?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"No, you couldn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I didn't realize you were a poet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Not a very good one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,For your paramour?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,For one of my daughters.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"You have several, don't you?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Eight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Eight? Eight daughters?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Beautiful name.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Which joke is that?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We can avenge them.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, we can avenge them."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I know he did.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Anything at all.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Oh, no, no, no."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, no, no, no."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,Hells. Gods.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Did you remove the skin?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, my lady. That was the cooks."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What are you doing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I'm helping you with your armor.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I killed a man.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Who?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,How did you kill a Kingsguard?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,rast,"Hey. Hey, get up. Get up."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,"That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,Aye. What we need is a girl there.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,I've got to have a piss.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,Now keep quiet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,You need water.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,It doesn't matter.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,Of course it matters.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,You mustn't let anything stop you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,They already have stopped me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,No. You're not here. You're far from here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,What does that mean?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,"You've seen it, too."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,"Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,We will.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,How... will we know the end?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,You'll know.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Brothers.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,dolorous edd,You do move quiet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,How many?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,Not yet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Why?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,"They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,New moon tonight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,Get her up.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,Stop.

You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,"If you let my sister go, I can help you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,You can help me?

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,And how you gonna do that?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,I have the sight. I can see things.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,That's very helpful.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,Things that haven't happened yet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,What a fine thing. A fine thing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,dolorous edd,What should we do with this lot?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,morag,"Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way."

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Yes, we have heard this story."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,It's not a story. It's the truth.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,Gold you loaned him.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,More than any man living.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,"4,000."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,32.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,None.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,My lord.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,The war is over.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,Ser Davos...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,Humor me.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,Tywin Lannister.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,How old is Tywin Lannister?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,67.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,That is a problem for another time.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,"The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, ""Bring me my red shirt."" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, ""Two pirate ships!"" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, ""Bring me my red shirt!"""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,"After the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"" The captain replies, ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."" The next morning the lookout screams, ""10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!"" The crew goes silent."

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,Only half rotted.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.

On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,theon greyjoy,But how can--
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Your father crucified innocent children.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what traditions do you speak of?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Disgraceful.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Make it 100. What else?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The Targaryen girl?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Conquered with what?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Mormont is spying on her for us.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"How, my lord? By force?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Prince Oberyn.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And yet everyone does.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Five years.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,May I ask why?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Most of us aren't princes.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,It's a long story.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,One you don't like telling people.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,People I trust.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You did like boys before?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,What then?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Nothing.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Everybody is interested in something.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Such as?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Really?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father's orders.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,man,Kingslayer!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tommen lannister,"I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,No.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Not that I know of.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"How would you say he died, then?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Choked on his pigeon pie.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,So you would blame the bakers?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The crown may call its first witness.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,meryn trant,"Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,By whom?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Without question.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pyelle,It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,Your own brother said this to you?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"You're excused, Lord Varys."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,One.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,We will adjourn for now.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Toll the bells in an hour's time.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,guard,Clear the court!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You'd condemn your own son to death?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I know nothing of the sort.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You've always hated Tyrion.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,He killed his king.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Justice?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,He'll be executed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"No, he'll be punished accordingly."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I'm well aware of your oath.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Done.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,And you have mine.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Not going well, is it?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You're going to be found guilty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you think so?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Do you trust me?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The crown may call its next witness.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,State your name.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Shae.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I swear it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Do you know this man?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,How do you know him?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I know that he's guilty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,He and Sansa planned it together.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence! Continue.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,His whore.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,How did you come to be in his service?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence. Silence!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And did you?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Did I what?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Shae. Please don't.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You wish to confess?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You admit you poisoned the king?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,You fell in love with a whore.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,It is tempting.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,If he wins.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,No. Not Ser Meryn.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,"Go on, move it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,And you. Come on.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,prisoner,"Mercy. Please. Please, mercy."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,You seem to be in good form.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mountain,Who am I fighting?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Does it matter?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Could be food.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Could be soldiers.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Who were ""they""?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,I stopped asking a while ago.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,That's not gonna get better.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Doesn't seem so.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,So why go on?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Habit.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Nothing could be worse than this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Who are you?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,You her father?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Wish it were wine.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,So do I.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,The fuck you doing?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,There's a price on your head.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,He can't be. I don't know his name.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,What's your name?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,Rorge.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Thank you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,You're learning.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,Rangers returning!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,They return!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Greetings.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,Didn't think I'd see you again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sam,"All right, Jon?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,"Welcome back, brother."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Lord Snow.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Come on, Ghost."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,janos slynt,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We need to prepare.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,We've been preparing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,And how would we range north?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We wouldn't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,grenn,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,They won't stop them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The stewards.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Who would that be?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The builders.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,Aye.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lord.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You have new clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I sent for you days ago.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I've been a bit busy.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Doing what?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She's dim-witted.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Does he frighten you so much?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Because you're my friend.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,We had some good days together.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, we did."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What will you do?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,But your window is not.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Don't do that again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Tell me why you're here.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"There is only one, and she does not want me."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You swore me your sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,My sword is yours till the day I die.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Do what you do best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Take off your clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Oh.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Come in, my queen. Please."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,You could never disturb me.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Not always.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Did you use it with Stannis?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,I understand how you feel.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Hmm.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,But that is impossible.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You're here early.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Later than some.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You neither approve nor trust.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I trust you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,You have?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,No fire.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,No fire!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Couldn't agree more, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Yes, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Don't get drunk.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"No, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Can I get you anything else?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Thanks. I do my best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,We're looking for someone.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,What?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"It's nothing, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,What about? Not kidney pie.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,When was that?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,So what happened to her?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Well-
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,The quick version.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,The Hound.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Um, you were saying?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Why the Eyrie?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Sansa could be there, too."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Aye, my lady. Could be."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You sure about this?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Your sister.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I think I would have remembered that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,That would have made things so much easier.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I disagree.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Hello, Robin."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,What are you doing?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Why did you leave?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,It's a long story.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Yes, you certainly are."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,When will you go back?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,We don't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I like the sound of that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,All right.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,It can go in here in this big tower.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I didn't ruin it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I didn't ruin it!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You're being stupid.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I hit him.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Yes, I saw."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I shouldn't have done that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Lord Baelish...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Call me Petyr.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"

2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,Do you know how far the fall is?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I didn't. You don't understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,He kissed me. I pulled away.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,Liar! Whore! He is mine!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Please!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Lysa! Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,You want her? This empty-headed child?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."

2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"Well, what are you going to say?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,I'm sorry it woke you up.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Don't you ever touch him.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Shut your mouth.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,No it's not.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,I should never have left her there.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,You couldn't have known.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,She's dead because of me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pyp,"Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,She might have.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,A hundred thousand.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,"And there's what, 5 of us left."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,"If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pyp,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You think he was spying on you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"No, not spying."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,Yes your grace.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,But you are not Dothraki.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,He was interested.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I believe he was interested.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,All of it?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The...the pillar an the stones.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"I don't know, your grace."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Haven't you ever wondered?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"Yes, your grace."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,To me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,To me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,Why? Why sorry?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,in Valyrian* So am I.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,And what are you really?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,I'm Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Until when?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Always. Forever.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,And why should I believe that?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,everyone,What is dead may never die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,And what does Lord Bolton want?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,He wants us to surrender?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,shame fought with honor.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,scared* You don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,The Ironborn will not surrender.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,whispering* Reek. Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,I believe we will. To our new home.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,My lord...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"A niece of yours, I believe."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,We'd like to speak with her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Let me fetch her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,My lady...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,I wasn't asking you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,He can stay.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser vance,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Lady Sansa.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Are you questioning our courage?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,More often they die young.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Aye, it's time."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,boy,Ser Barristan.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Yes? Who sent you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Ser Barristan.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Ser Jorah.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,What's this?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Who gave you this?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Does it matter?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Have you told her?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Let me speak with her in private.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,You'll never be alone with her again.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Why did the usurper pardon you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,If we could speak alone.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,It is not forged.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Why, then?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What was the content of these letters?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Information.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What information?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Yes or no?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Khaleesi.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Because you knew it was poisoned.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I suspected.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You betrayed me from the first.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,and you want me to forgive you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I have loved you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Daenerys, please."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord bolton,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moors, fields, hills."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Tell me what you see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Nothing.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,roose,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Ramsay Snow.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,roose,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Yes?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,That's not an answer.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,I don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Neither do I.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,I know what you want.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Do you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,Lots of things make me happy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,Like what?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You should have let me burn it.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,It's a fleabite.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Aye, she'll pay."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,I've never even met her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,I'm not a lady.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,You shouldn't be.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Shall we go?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Soon.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I've never seen him fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Oberyn believes in himself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Beheading.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Cousins.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,together,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Nothing made him happier.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"The joke wore thin, though."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,For you. You drifted away.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I had other interests.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,He was twice your size.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Good luck today.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Looks like very light armor.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I like to move around.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Today is not the day I die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,You're going to fight that?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to kill that.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Thank the gods.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pycell,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,Don't leave me alone in this world.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Never.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Have they told you who I am?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,Some dead man.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tywin lannister,"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,What was she like?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,She...she had red hair.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Oh? How big were her feet?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Well what do you want me to say?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,So you and Gilly never-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"No, you're really not."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,There will.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Yes.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,We could be waiting here a while.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I probably killed him already.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,So you've said.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,Maybe I have.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Let me help you.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Maester Faull
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I don't love her.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes you do.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,No.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,You were?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Who was she?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Pyp! Open the gate.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I can't.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Sam, is that you?!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Yes!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I've never heard you curse before.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,It was horrible.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Never.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,I know there's no women allowed.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Get ready!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,thenn warg,It's time.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,Pick up the pace!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,A hundred thousand you say?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Yes sir.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,You can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,You're leaving me again?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I'm not leaving you!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,What are you going to do out there?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Help my brothers.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,Promise me you won't die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I promise you I won't die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,But you're afraid now?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,How high are the walls?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,Let's kill some Crows!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"Archers knock, everyone else hold."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,nights watch,No Ser!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,You all plan to die here tonight?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,That's very good to hear. Draw!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,member,"Help, down below."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,They're attacking the southern gates!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Now?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,Now!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,What?!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,You heard the man. Loose!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,"You, over there."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Did you get one?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Yeah?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I think we're gonna die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,If you keep missing we will.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,nights watch,No!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,The Night's Watch will stand.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"With me now! Now, with me!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We can't just let them attack the gate!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,"Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,Needed below? Yes. Yes.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,They won't summit before dawn.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,How do you know that?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Because I've made that claim.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ed,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Knock! Draw! Loose!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Oh, is it over?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,Huh?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,But we need men here.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What are you doing up here?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Two brothers now fight with me.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ed,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,donnel,How are we gonna stop that?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,cooper,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,"You heard Jon, we hold the gate."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,donnel,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,We hold the gate!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,donnel,Mother save me. Father save me.

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"

I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,to Sam* I don't want you out there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I need him more than I need you.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,We need you boy.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Jon Snow.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"No, shh, don't talk."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Do you remember that cave?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We'll go back there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ed,They've had enough for one night.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ed,Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,This is how a man ends.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,I shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Aye, you shouldo ve."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,We held them off.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,For one night.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,This is a great victory.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Where are you going?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I'm going to find Mance.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I'm going to try.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,What are you doing?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Jon. Come back.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You're wearing a black cloak again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Yes.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,And?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She's dead.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Your doing?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,No.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We'll drink to her.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Ygritte.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Ygritte.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,That's not wine.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn came from a farm.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Mag and Grenn.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn and Mag.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Turn your army around and go home.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You attacking us?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Hold! To me. To me.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,You're the king beyond the wall?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,You know who I am?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Never had the pleasure.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We do not kneel.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"All the same, we do not kneel."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Take these men away.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Your father was an honorable man.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"He was, your grace."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,What do you think he'd have done with him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Bloody Martells.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"It is, yes, manticore."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Yes there is.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,May I ask what you think you're doing?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Saving him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Not anymore.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,You can save him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Will it weaken him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Oh no.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Very well then.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm opening it again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I will not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,No.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,And how will you do that?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'll tell everyone the truth.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,And what truth would that be?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,Known what?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"No, no, no, no, no."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Your legacy is a lie.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,I don't believe you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes you do.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Jaime.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Tyrion is your family.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,He's not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You don't get to choose.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"

2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I choose you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Those are words.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Told him what?

2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You told him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You think he'll just accept that?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Go and ask him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,What did you say?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Someone will walk in.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I don't care.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,"in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."

2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,You speak it very well.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."

2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,What is it that you want from me?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,barristan,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
