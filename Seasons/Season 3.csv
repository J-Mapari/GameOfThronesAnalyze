2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,Did you send the ravens?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,"That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."

2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,Crow!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,boy,Crow!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,girl,Look over there!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,girl,Crow! Look over here! Look!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,woman,"Ah, look, crow coming!"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,You're wearing the wrong color.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Mance was a ranger.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Sure, you will."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,boy,Oh!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,What happened to their fathers?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,I smell a crow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rattleshirt,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,What do we want with a baby crow?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,He wants me to lead one day.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I want to be free.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,You saw what?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,We'll need to find you a new cloak.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,What if you took off that bit there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,I want you to take it off.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,Mouth.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I didn't hear that.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,"Apologies, ser."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Lord Tyrion sent me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"I will murder you, boy."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,He said it was a matter of life and death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Pod?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,It's your sister. The queen.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,What are they doing here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think so."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,They stay outside.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're meeting Father today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How do you know that?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're going to make me cry.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why do you care what I want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Slandered? When?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I was nine, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It's not slander if it's true.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Any lies in particular?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Still makes me more clever than you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,Ser Meryn Trant.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,You're no knight.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Pod.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I've been doing that for a while now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Do you grow bored protecting me?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I grow poor protecting you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Briefly.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I thought we were friends.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How much?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Double?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Which means you can afford it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Here. Here! Help me!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,Who are you?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,"Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,He may have swam ashore as you did.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Will you take me there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,This war is not over.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,We're both sworn to King Stannis.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,What?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I'm a pirate.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You're a smuggler.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Take me back there, please."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,You cannot turn Stannis against her.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard karstark,Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,"The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard karstark,Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,A Mallister?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,catelyn stark,Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,She's your mother.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Water. Water.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,This needs to be cleaned and closed.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,"What's your name, friend?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Qyburn.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,You're lucky to be alive.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Lucky?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Am I enjoying it?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,blows on his paper to dry the ink.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You want Casterly Rock?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It is mine by right.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Why Dorne?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Don't ruin the game.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"I told you, I don't want to play."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,What about that one there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,That one? It's going to Volantis.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Lord Baelish.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,I won't tell anyone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,How do I know?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,You're her handmaiden?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Yes. And you're his...?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,I help manage his affairs.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,He's an important person.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,"So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Yes.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,Given where we started.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,And where is that?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,I always do.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,Watch out for her with him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,They're growing fast.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I heard you were dead.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Not yet.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,We are alone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I am fighting.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,By burning prisoners alive?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,I'm not your enemy.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You are my enemy.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,Death by fire is the purest death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Your Grace!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Come on.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,She will destroy us all!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,I will pray for you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Guard
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Guard #2
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,Why have we stopped?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,"It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,maid,"My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Pardon me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,maid,"Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,I have others.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,"Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,No.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And your mother?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,She died when she had me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"That's a lovely gown, my lady."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Yes.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,I'm sure she does.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,They will stand until they drop.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Such is their obedience.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Even the bravest men fear death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,The knight says even brave men fear death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell the old man he smells of piss.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"Truly, master?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,"No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Tell the good master there is no need.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,"Here, I'm done with you."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,unsullied,This one is pleased to have served you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,What a soft mewling fool this one is.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,How many do you have to sell?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Eight thousand.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Eight thousand dead babies.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own them, these men..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,They're not men. Not anymore.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,The warlocks.

2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,You know this man?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,barristan,"King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Relax your bow arm.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",eddard stark,And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Father?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"You can't kill it, you know."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Why not?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Because the raven is you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hodor,Hodor.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"It's all right, Hodor."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,He's back.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,I don't want to hear about it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,But you asked.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"I know you didn't, little lord."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,We need to move.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Some good he is, then."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Never?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."

2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",roose bolton,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Something else?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Have you received any demands?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I want to do this.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,So how shall we pass the time?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,By putting one foot in front of the other.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,All the good it's done her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,How would you know?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Move.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Gods, no."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Shut your mouth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I did not fancy him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Oh, gods, you did."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I'm not interested in foul rumors.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Shut your mouth!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Where are you headed, then?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,South. You?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"No, you really can't."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,And you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He knows who I am.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,He doesn't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Make it tighter here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tailor,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Bloody flowers. On the king.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Tell me what you think of her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Who?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"Yes, she is."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Not to me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,I don't need to do anything.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Better. Much better.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I still don't believe it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Love is not the thing he wants.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's too old.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Send him in.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,Lady Sansa.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Ser Loras.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,Of course I did.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",maid,Thank you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You're such a dear.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Kiss me, child."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"I-, I-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",servant,"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,My father always told the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Go on.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's a monster.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,We're at war. This march is a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,Then it's a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,If you no longer believe-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,You don't think we can win?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,I think you lost this war the day you married her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"Whoa, whoa."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,Your Grace.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,You've made them before?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Twice.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,Did they work?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,Which boy?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,And he lived.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,I understand.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"Well, how could you understand?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,You want to protect your people.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tormund,Shouldn't be long now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,What's wrong with him?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ygritte,"What, you've never met a warg?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Orell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Where were you this time?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",orell,The Fist of the First Men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,What did you see?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",orell,Dead crows.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"Hey. Get up, Sam."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Get up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,I can't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"If you stop, you'll die."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,"Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,You don't care.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,Course we care.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,"Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Help me get him up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Looks like that piggy is done for.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Help us get him up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,He's slowing us down.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Just get him up!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"Aye, I think so."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"If he can't, we may as well just go without him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Why should the rest of us-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"Rast, you're responsible for him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,What am I supposed to do?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Where's Rickon and Hodor?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,Looking for food.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,What's out there?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,I'm unarmed.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,That was poor planning.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,My sister carries the weapons.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,I'm better with them. Drop the spear.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Drop it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,You must be SUMMER.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,I'm just trying to understand.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Would you please shut up about it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,I'm not listening.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Shut up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,But you could have ended the war.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Where are we going?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,North.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Maybe we already passed it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Could be a minstrel.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,A lion still has claws...
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hot pie,"A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Shh.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Loose a few more shafts.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Don't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Put the sword down, girl."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,Generous.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,What friends?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Who are you?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"No, who do you fight for?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hot pie,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Here's the thing, fat"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,Half the country's starving and look at this one.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,My lion.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I don't know her name.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,How do you know her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,She's a whore.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,You fucked her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,And was she good? Did you like her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,We have to protect her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,You pervert. You want her? This child?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,But you are.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Hmm, yes."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Now do you think I'm cruel?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"Lady Tyrell, my king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Send her in.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You failed to do this.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,What makes you say this?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"No, he was a known degenerate."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You are the king.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Yes. I am.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,The bolt goes here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,And then you just aim and-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,It's not unheard of.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,My father would never let me before-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,May I? Please.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Would you like to watch me?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Tell us the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,About what?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I don't know what you want.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I want the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,What truth?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Why'd you take Winterfell?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I took it to-I took it-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Who gave the orders?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,No one. I took it on my own.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Why?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,What were you going to do once you took it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Hold it. Rule it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Good. That's very good.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Why did you do that?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,What are you doing?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay bolton,Your sister sent me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Yara?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay bolton,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Rickon, stay with us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Only when I'm asleep.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,A three-eyed raven?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,You've seen it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Does it have anything to do with warging?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,What's he telling him?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Why don't you ask?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Where's the shame in that?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"You have the sight, too?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Yeah.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,What else have you seen?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Only one thing that matters-you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,I don't drink ale.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,Yeah!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,We're not children.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,That's because he's twice as good.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Aha! A smith and a salesman.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Gendry stole us weapons.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,My brothers taught me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",men,Ooh!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,To your brothers!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,You'll free us?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,I gave you my word.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Hey, hey."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"A pretty prize, lads."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",men,Yeah!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,Girl.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Silence, Kingslayer."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Good luck.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Be quick about it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I need to rest.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Get up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Get up now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,You sure he's the one?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,Give the man his silver.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,Robb knows I meant him no disr-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,I seized an opportunity.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,What value was the mill?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Is he there now? Of course not.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,No.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,How many men did you lose?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,We seem to be running short of patience here.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,What news of Jaime?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"We are trying, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,pycelle,A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Master of Coin?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,cersei lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,pycelle,"Hear, hear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,men,"He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,You were armed when we were taken.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,You were not beating me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,Would I?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,You think I care about my teeth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,What does it matter?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What am I?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"So I can walk away, then?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Better than anyone you've ever met.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,A cowardo s weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Why? So you can kiss him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,You remember the last time you were here?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Watch your head. Off we go.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,driver,Walk up!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,I'm staying.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,You're what?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,Winterfell.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,You sure?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,I'm sure.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Well, I made you something."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What is it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,It's a wolf.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,That's the tail?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,Yeah.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"Well, be safe."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,You don't burn your fingers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Good-bye, Arry."

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,You're Robb Stark's wife.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,Hold still.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,Is it true what they say about him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,I don't know. What do they say about him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,True.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,"True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,Martyn Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,"Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,Always the artists.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,It's only horses. No men.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ygritte,You said there was dead crows.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,orell,There was.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,How many men were here?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,About three hundred.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,And you know what those men are now?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,Do you think anyone got away?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tormund,"We're finally going to war, old friend?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tormund,We'll meet again.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,orell,How will we see your signal?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sam,Ghost?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,What have we here? Frozen crows?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,We've come a long way.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,Smaller flock than you went north with.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,We can talk inside.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Oh, can we?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,They need some water.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,Tether it and I'll be inside.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,karl tanner,Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,You are a godly man?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,Here we are.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,"Sharpen these for me, would ya?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,I see the head. Push.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gilly,What is it? What is it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Keep quiet.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,I can ride.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,You're sure?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,Come on back.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,How long will you be gone?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I don't know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You're abandoning me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Then serve me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"When I return, you will understand."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I cannot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Why?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I want you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"Your fires burn low, my king."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,There is another way. A better way.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,Yes.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm the one true king.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,To whom?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Give me your water.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,And what is she to do for soldiers?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,Three.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,They did not. I want to buy them all.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,She wants to buy them all.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,The slut cannot pay for all of this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,The gold you have left is worth ten.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,The Dothraki you have with you-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,I will give her three for those.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I have dragons. I'll give you one.

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,Aegon Targaryen proved that.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a name?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"No, Your Grace. No family living."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Not for bastards.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ros,"That's all of them, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Thank you, my dear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,You should have him knighted.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We don't. I did fuck her once.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,But we don't.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Keep a low profile.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Well, you are richer than I am."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Good point.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You think all reading is dull reading.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Podrick.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"No, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Uh, my lord"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,marei,He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"My lord, I don't even"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Be back in time for my supper.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Pace yourself, lad."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,No.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's stealing it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What's wrong with that?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,And what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, you have to."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,But what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,The lado s practically skipping.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"They wouldn't take it, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What did you tell them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,I didn't tell them anything.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,What did you do to them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,Lots of things.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,And they seemed to like these things?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Only they weren't paid.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Is that what you're telling us?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,doesn't deny it.>/i>
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Sit down, Podrick."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We're going to need details. Copious details.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,Ha! Ha!

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,Take off his pants.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No, no, no!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,"No, please! No! No!"

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,You're only making it worse.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,Come on!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You know who she is, don't you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,I'm gonna cut your throat!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I know what they are.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Bring her back here.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Yes, my lord. Get up."

2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Fancy word for a fancy man.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I bet you did.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Aye, you have both."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Hard to argue with that.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Come on, men."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I'm famished, actually."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Well, I do like partridge."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,On the stump.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,My father-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Don't.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Have you got something to say?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."

2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"If I die, you won't be getting-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"Oh, enough. Here."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,Stop!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,Far enough.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,"Come on, you."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, always in confidence."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,End your life?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Proof? Will there be a trial?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I need to know.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I don't know. Do I?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,You do not possess at the moment.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,The sorcerer.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,Or the shit.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,"Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,We need to get out of here.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,He had no way of knowing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,We do now. We know what's out there.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,Craster's been out here surviving.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,We're like the sons he never had.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,"Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,"Shh, shh, shh."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,You woke him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Shh!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,No.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,Are you going to give him one?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Why?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Here.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,Gilly.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,I wanted you to have it.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jojen,You have to go after him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,How?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jojen,You know how.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,Brandon.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,Mother.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you? No climbing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,"Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,Mother! Mother!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,"Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Is he very large?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Extraordinary.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What did he do to them?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,So what did they say?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,They said it was hard to describe.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What makes you say so?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,His shipboard inventory.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Former profession.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,How do you know?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Because I'm one of his girls.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gendry baratheon,What is this place?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You look like a bunch of swineherds.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,And I won't see them again.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You're fighting for ghosts.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You found god? Is that it?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,"You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,"And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,Murder is a crime.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya stark,You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"Aye, he was a bleeder."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,You don't deny killing this boy?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya stark,That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,It is done.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,It is done.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,She holds the whip.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,You hold the whip.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,The bitch has her army.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Forward march!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Halt!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,A dragon is not a slave.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,You speak Valyrian?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,I am your master.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon us."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,"Lord of Light, defend us."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Get back.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Kill him!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"Arya, don't!"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Bring him back from death and darkness
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,No! Let go of me! Let me go!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Burn in hell!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,He will. But not today.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,How often do these patrols go out?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,You'd like to know that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Three.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,You sure of that?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Which three?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Castle Black.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,How many men remain in Castle Black?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Liar.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,He's no crow.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not afraid of you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,"I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand men.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,We'll find out soon enough.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't need you to protect me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Give it back.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,All of me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,We shouldn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,We should.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Hmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,You seemed to like it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,There's been no one else. Only you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,A maid. You were a maid.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,What do you think?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Who was he?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not done with you yet.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,How long's it been since you had a bath?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,I want my gold.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,anguy,We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,"Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Not in the eyes of god.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You can't!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,Riders coming through!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,The Kingslayer.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,Down!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,"Pick him up, Locke."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You've lost a hand.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"No, my lord, he has it here."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Take this away.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,Send it to his father?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,"Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,"Thank you, my lord."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Is there word from the capital?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Will I die?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,No milk of the poppy.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,There will be pain.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,Quite a bit of pain.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream loudly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I shall do my best.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I assure you that it will.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,podrick,"Pardon, my lady."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Naturally.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I understand that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Good.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I would.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,My lady-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Quite sufficient. Thank you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Give me that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,What are you doing?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Why?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You don't have to do this.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,I want to. They need good men.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I can be your family.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,Willem. Willem!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,willem,Is this a rescue?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Lannister filth! Take him!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,"Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Bring them in.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,They were boys! Look at them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Leave him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn stark,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn stark,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,"A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Kneel, my lord."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Don't think of it that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,But it is that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It is. And it isn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,More is than isn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,So why don't you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,We need the gold.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"Do I frighten you, child?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I thought he killed you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,He did.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,But how?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,How many times?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Five, I think. No, this makes six."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Six.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Then I was stabbed in the belly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,And the Hound makes six.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"I don't think it works that way, child."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I would. You're alive.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,My lady.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I meant to come sooner. The battle-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"Yes, of course."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I believed that once.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You're doing godo s work.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,That's not true.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You are a king. You don't need my permission.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Shireen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Father!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You've grown since I last saw you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,He did. He fought bravely.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"He won't be visiting, child."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Why not? He's my friend. Look.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,What are you doing here?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Now get out.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,There's another tub.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Why should I care how you die?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Don't you mock me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,You need trust to have a truce.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I trust you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Of course.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Shh, you'll wake Bert."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Bert?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Aye. So they did.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Take it. I have more.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"My lady, I can't read the words."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,You can't?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,No. No. No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,It's easy. It'll be fun.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Go. We can't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,I wouldn't know where to start.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,It was a bitch of a siege.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You swore an oath.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,With all my heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,These are the ones?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,Remove your helmet
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,This one has the honor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,What is your name?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,Grey Worm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,Grey Worm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,"From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,"Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,King Robert wanted her dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,I didn't sit on the small council.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Mm-hmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,Which men do you have in mind?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Come to bed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You were right.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Don't let him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Give them a new purpose.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,What is it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Can you do it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,Squire!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Well fought, ser."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,That was no fight. I don't know you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Olyver, if it please you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,How did you know?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,Know what?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,That I wanted to.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,"My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"They rarely do, in my experience."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,"You have a good deal of experience, do you?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,With the husbands.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,That didn't take long.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,What is?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Is it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Many ladies wear it this way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,You still want me to come with you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"I do, Lord Baelish."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Petyr.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Petyr.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,We'll speak again when I return.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're late.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,What's she doing here?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your jokes are not appreciated.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't my best, but-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And how do we do that?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Wonderful.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Yes, it is."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,You can't mean it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,I can and I do.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,She's a child!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And if I refuse?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Only too well.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You'll marry Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I will not.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"No, I won't do it."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,You've got too much wood in there.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Huh. You know your fires.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Someone built your fires for you growing up?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,I knew you were highborn.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,What does it do?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,How much longer?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Not so far. A few more days.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Is the Wall as big as they say?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,You're playing with me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Do you sing?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Sing me a song.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,That's not how you skin a rabbit.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I know how to skin a rabbit.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Not by the looks of it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I didn't see any game before I got here.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You learn how to use your fists, though."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,I had someone else in mind.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, someone else is sitting right here."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Some of us are just a little better.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,Stop it!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,hodor,Hodor.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,"First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"I said so, didn't I?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,Osha!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,You're a good little hunter.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Don't push me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,Shh. I'm right here with you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,rickon,What's happening?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I'm right here with you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,rickon,What's wrong with him?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,The visions take their toll.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,He's having one now?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jojen,I saw Jon Snow.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You saw him? At Castle Black?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jojen,He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,Your flock gets smaller every year.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You ever climbed it before?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Aren't you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You kill someone for them?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Can we not talk about that here?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Did I seem scared the other day?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You were trembling like a leaf.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Only in the beginning.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,What secret?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,I won't.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,"Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,"Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,"Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,But I have to aim.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Never aim.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Never aim?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,There's someone out there.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,That's about far enough.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,We come as friends.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,"Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,Valar morghulis.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You are Thoros of Myr.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,I failed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Lucky for the ladies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,How many times has the Lord brought him back?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Six.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,That's not possible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,The Lord has smiled upon me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You should not have this power.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You've been to the other side.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You have someone He needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,I'll get you the steel.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,man,Come on.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,I don't like that woman.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,That's 'cause you're a girl.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"Forgive me, lad."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What are you doing? Let go of him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry baratheon,You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,Look out!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You all right?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,"Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Sorry. Were you sleeping?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Wa-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Please is not a body part.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you everything, please."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"If I win, you'll let me go?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,The North.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Too vague.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Deepwood Motte.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Terrible guess.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now, where?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Last Hearth.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Karhold!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,No. It was just a guess.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Torrhen Karstark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,You swore to tell me if I-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You're right.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Yes. You win.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I'm afraid I am.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Everything I told you is a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I win.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I don't think that's-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,And there's something else.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"Not what, whom."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,What?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,How old is she?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Nineteen.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,Could I see her first?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,catelyn stark,You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,You recall that heroic engagement?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I had something less permanent in mind.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I'll marry her.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I should send you back to Robb Stark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,He'll make time for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,Shall we drink on it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I don't partake.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"Oh, she won't be going with you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You are charged with abetting treason.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,I'm afraid I must insist.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Impossible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Why?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Old.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Old?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,And you never-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Never.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Oh
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,No!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,We've gotta cut them loose!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,No!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Take my hand!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,That's a wonderful pin.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I'm very happy about
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,We can have them both killed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,On a boat you built.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,What do you want me to say?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Who's going to tell her?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Do you think people will like it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I don't think they will even notice it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I'm sure he does.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Will they let me invite my family?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,They haven't asked my opinion.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,But do you think they will?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,maid,"Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Alone, if I may."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"It's all right, really."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How far are we?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"About a week, I think."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You think? You don't know?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Most of the time, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How do the men holding the banners fight?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,So what good are they?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,They help the men march.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"She's right, you don't."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,That rain will cost us another day.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,"Yes, and that is why-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,"I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,"I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,edmure,He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Attack. Attack.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Who are you writing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,My mother.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Is that Valyrian?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Gaaa.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Gaaa? Say hello for me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Rytsas.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Ritsas.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,That was close enough.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Not yet.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Many surprises for her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I will.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"What, now? Are you certain?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Are you angry with me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Angry? You're my queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Maybe one of each.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Don't get greedy.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Can you leave the war for one night?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tormund,Most men fuck like dogs.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tormund,"No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"What, you're jealous?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Don't touch me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Come on. Come walk with me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,No.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has he been kind to you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's tried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"You don't want him, though."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a Lannister.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,If it's the pain you're worried about-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,She's a child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,She's a foot taller than you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,A tall child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,What's the youngest you've ever had?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Not that young.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,How much older?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Older.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Shae isn't going to like it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I should never have told you about that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Your Grace.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Grandfather.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You wanted to speak to me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"I have, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,May I ask why?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,"So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,We could arrange to have you carried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Where did you hear about this?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Is it true?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Apparently so.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,But I haven't been counseled.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You are being counseled at this very moment.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,I should be consulted about such things.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,"The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Two hundred thousand if not more.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,You may approach. Sit.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,Will the noble lord take refreshment?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,My ship?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,And what do you ask in return?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,My life?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,You swore me safe conduct.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,Take the gold.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Find out.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Chains?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Golden chains.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You could buy a ship with these.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Do I need a ship?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Am I going somewhere?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Of course you're not going anywhere.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,"So, am I invited to your wedding?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't have a choice. My father-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I swear to you it will not be like that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,No? What will it be like?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,I'm not your lady.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You are. You'll always be my lady.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,"I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,What happened?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Wildfire. I should have been here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,"After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Do you miss it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,King's Landing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,Never had a father. Never wanted one.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I was born in Flea Bottom.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your blood is noble.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,"Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,There. Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I'm just a bastard.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"Come sit by the fire, child."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,"Not talking, eh? That's a first."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,I don't talk to traitors.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,I didn't like giving up the boy.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,He's not my one true god.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,No? Who's yours?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Death.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,anguy,Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,How many?

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,How far?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,anguy,Less than a day's ride south.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,"What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,men,Yeah!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,It will still be west of here two days from now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,You swore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Why? So you can steal their gold?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"I swear to you, this isn't-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"One day you'll understand, but now-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"Anguy, bring her back."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,man,"Come back, girl!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sandor clegane,"Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good."

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I owe you a debt.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,It will take time.

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,roose bolton,"You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,"Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her."

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,We heard so much about it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Oh! There it is.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,Help me. If he comes back-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,We need to make him feel better.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,And how can we make him feel better?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,I have an idea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,As good as they say?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Mmm.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,And why should you get all the fun?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,What? You like her better?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Plenty there for both of us.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,I was here first.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,But I was getting jealous.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,"Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You're gonna scare it off.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's too far away.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Is that a palace?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's a windmill.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Just the men who used to live here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's swooning?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Fainting.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's fainting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Well not all girls are like you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Would you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,So I could tear it off you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You know nothing-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And how do you know that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Mance is different.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You don't know that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,All of us.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Yes, first we'll live."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,hodor,Hodor.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,That's where we are.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What are you telling him?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,"It's all right, Osha."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,meera,Leave him alone.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,He can speak for himself.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,I don't fill his head with anything.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,So what do you talk about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,What's happening to him and what that means.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,We're not going to Castle Black.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What did you say?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,You don't understand. You don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"How is the pain, my lord?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"Well, we've stymied the corruption."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,All the good it's done me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"Faint praise, my lord."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What is?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You performed experiments on living men.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,On dying men.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,With their permission?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"How many men have you killed, my lord?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Fifty? A hundred?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Countless.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Countless has a nice ring to it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,And how many lives have you saved?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A fair offer.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Why not?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,He feels he's being cheated.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,They'd be fools to kill her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We have to return to Harrenhal.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Why?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I've left something behind.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,And what are those orders?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You think you'll get a reward.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,I had nothing-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Whoa.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,"Eyes open, lads."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Be quiet.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,men,"The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,man,Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A wooden sword?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,I thought you'd gone.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You gave her a wooden sword.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,We've only got one bear.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Ah!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Get behind me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,I will not.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Pull her up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Hold my legs.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Pull him up!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,The bitch stays.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"I'll give you one try, girl."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,There's no one worse than you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,You're lying.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Is that the Blackwater?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,But why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Why would they be at the Twins?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You know these men?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Is he more titan or bastard?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,How many?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Enough to make a difference?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,I imagine you're right.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,He may not agree to meet.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Daario Naharis
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,Mind your tongue.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"You, slave girl, bring wine."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,We have no slaves here.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Under two thousand, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"We have more, don't we?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,Ten thousand Unsullied.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You're very young to be a captain.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Or you could fight for me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,I would pay you as much and more.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,"Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,grey worm,"My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"A barrel, then."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Gladly, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What do you mean to do with him?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You know what I mean to do with him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You've slaughtered many lambs?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,And none have seen the blade.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Your Grace.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,They feeding you enough?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You don't belong in a place like this.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Melisandre's returned.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I didn't know she'd been gone.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,She says there's power in king's blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,She's going to kill him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Sacrifice him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Because he has your blood in his veins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,So did Renly.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You have little regard for your own life.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You talk too much.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I fight for beauty.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,For beauty?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,We fight for gold.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You'll die young.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,She's well guarded.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,Which one of us?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Close your eyes, love."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You have something for me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Valar morghulis.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"You look very handsome, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,When I have to.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, today you have to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"You look radiant, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Radiant? Why radiant?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,It's the word that came to mind.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Of course. They play it so often here at court.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Gone.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Could you-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Thank you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,"Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Have you ever seen one like it?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Here, taste this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You think I'm trying to poison you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,That's good.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,That's really good.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Where do you think it's from?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I couldn't even guess.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,There are no mistakes. Not for us.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,What are you doing?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You have to trust me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,What-? Get it away. Get it off me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,Why are you doing this?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,olenna tyrell,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,I've got a lifetime for that.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Stay.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,You seem rather drunk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,More than once.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,loras,"Well, my father once told me-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Congratulations, my lady."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,Time for the bedding ceremony.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,There will be no bedding ceremony.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,There will be if I command it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,What did you say? What did you say?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Nothing was ever wiser.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Astoundingly long.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,Fourteen.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,But your father-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What if I never want you to?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And so my watch begins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Ninteen
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Athjahakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Athjahaka.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Ath-ja-hakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Athjahakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,"Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,No screaming or she dies.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do you want?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Let her go.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"Don't scream, lovely girl."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You were sent here to kill me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,So why haven't you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I don't want to.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do your captains have to say about that?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You should ask them.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,We had philosophical differences.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Over what?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You're a strange man.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,And this is supposed to impress me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Yes.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Will you fight for me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Swear to me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You really ought to knock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,shae,I brought your breakfast.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,How hard can it be to build a fire?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,He winked at me before.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I doubt it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I saw him wink at me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,He blinked.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,A what?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,A wink is on purpose.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I'll build that fire.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Don't you think he should have a name?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I don't know many boys' names.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Craster.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Mormont.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Why is it a last name?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"No, Randyll Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Randyll is a handsome name.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Please don't name him Randyll.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Is your father cruel like mine?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Different manner of cruel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"Not Randyll, then."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Don't. Don't go out there.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I'll be back. I just want to look.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,It's come for the baby.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Stay back!
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,You stay back!
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"No, you can't have him! No!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,No!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Are you sure about this?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,It's dangerous.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Why are you telling me?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,We have enough men?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,If Walder Frey cooperates.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,merry,I'm Merry.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Very good.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Still can't see you. Old eyes.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Thank you, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,Where?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,There.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Your men but not you?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,grey worm,I trust him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,You leave tonight.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Very good. We'll prepare.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,"We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,How do you know all that?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,I read about it in a very old book.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,Yes.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,You're like a wizard.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Need a hand?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Need about eight hands.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Many thanks.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't! Don't kill him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Dead rats don't squeak.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,More than anyone you know.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That so?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That him?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Good.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where are we?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Wildlings.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,That's what Old Nan said.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,There's a storm coming.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I don't see any.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,It's as good a place to shelter as any.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Only one old man and eight good horses.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,What's one old man doing with eight horses?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,He breeds them for the Watch.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,How's he keep folks from stealing them?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch protects him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,"Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,And proper steel.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Let's carve him up.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I keep telling you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,Ygritte!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Clear the barn!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Best part of the animal.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Don't worry, they're still there."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I know they're still there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That give you some ideas?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Might do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,How did you get past it?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Some climb straight up the ice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,Hodor!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,"Well, we'll have to open them up again."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,There's a rider out there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Just one?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,There's more.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"It's just thunder, sweet giant."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,Hodor.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,I yield. I yield.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Wildlings.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Hunting.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Make him shut up. If they hear us…
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"To Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, calm down."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You need to keep quiet.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,They're gonna hear us.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, be quiet."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,What did you do?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Nothing. I don't know.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,What's That?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,That's a horse dying.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,Bring them over here.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,That was the last of them. The rest are dead.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I heard shouting up there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Thunder.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Maybe it's ghosts.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"That won't help you, grandpa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Where you riding?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,"Doesn't matter now, does it?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"No, it doesn't matter now."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,You understand.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,Let me stand at least.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,Let me go with a bit of dignity.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,The wolves are out there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I can't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"You just did, with him."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,A wolf is nothing compared to that.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,She looks sharp.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,Do it. Do it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Told ya. He's still one of them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"Go on, boy."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Go on!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Kill him!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,He's one of them!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,No!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Do you hear me?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,You're not gonna die for one of them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Do it. They'll find us if you don't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,You were right the whole time.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"When you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,Daario Naharis.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,That one was quick.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,There may be others.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,That's what you call a few guards?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roslin,"Lord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure,"You're a delight to me, my lady."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,septon,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure roslin,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,Is that safe?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,They're long gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,They can't do that north of the Wall?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,No one can do that. Anywhere.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Where?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,He'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Listen to me, little lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Don't worry, I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Me? I'm coming with you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Right now, I have to protect you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,We're not Southerners.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,And I don't want to leave you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Shhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You don't have to do any of this.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,I know how to swing a sword.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I learned to walk in darkness.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Say your good-byes, little man."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Keep this one safe. He means the world to me.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,And Daario Naharis?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"The city is yours, my queen."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"They're good, aren't they?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,lothar,They ought to be because they cost enough.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,Look at the crowd there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,The Godo s love to reward a fool.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Uncle.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,"What? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,I hope she makes you very happy.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Well, she's made me very rich."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Striking your king is an act of treason.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"No, don't. Don't insult them."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Your Grace.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,everybody,To bed! To bed! To bed!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure,"Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again ."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Poor girl.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,That is a very strange custom.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,It seems normal to you?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Boy or girl?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,Where are you going?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Got salt pork for the feast.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,The feast is over.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,It doesn't sound like it's over.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,"If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Got pig's feet, too ."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Robb!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,man,"You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,man,"Feast over yet, is it?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey man,"Aye, it's over!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,It's too late.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"The King in the North arises, heh heh."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,And why I would let him do that?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I'll find another.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Mother.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,The Lannisters send their regards.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,It's too late.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,Yah! Yah!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,"Go, move out!"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey men,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey men,The King in the North! The King in the North!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey man,Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey man,Here comes
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I have a list.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,A list of people you mean to kill?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,You should learn to ignore them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,So how should we punish them?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Who? Whom?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,I hear that you're a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Why sheep shift?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,That's the vulgar word for dung.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,My lady-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,"Well, you asked me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,girl,Oh! That's him!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,podrick,"My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Killed a few puppies today?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,"Show him. Come on, show him."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,"Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I am the king! I will punish you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come along.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I'm not tired.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I'm not tired!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Not you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You really think a crown gives you power?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. I think armies give you power.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,The Northerners will never forget.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I will not rape her.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Does that amuse you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Easy for me, is it?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Sansa.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,It's empty.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Let's find a place to sleep.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Don't, Hodor."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Maybe we shouldn't stay.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,You'd rather be out there?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,I always quite liked the horrible stories.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,So did I. Once.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,No. Who's he?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,The Blackfish escaped.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,As you say.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,You'll be needing a new young girl.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,Forever young.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Oh. And?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,But my father taught me to aim for their head.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Kill me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Sorry, what?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,A little louder.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Kill me!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You're no good to me dead. We need you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Stinking meat.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Th- Theon Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What is your name?!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Reek. My name is Reek.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Don't kill me!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Who are you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Sam! Sam!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Who are you?!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Gilly. Don't hurt us.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Where are you going?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"My brother, he's in the Night's-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Shush.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Who's your brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Doesn't matter.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"No, I'm not."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Take us north of the Wall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,What? Why in the world would you want to go-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,I don't want to. I have to.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,How did you get through the Wall?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,How do you know all that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,But you're going to stop them?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Theon disobeyed my orders.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,He's your son.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Son? He's not a man anymore.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,Get those ropes!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,What is it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Dragonglass.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Why? What are they for?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Killing White Walkers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,How do you know that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Take it, Hodor."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,I wish I could. I really do.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,How are you keeping?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Great. Never better.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,It was just a bit of blood.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I'm not a highborn.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,She called you Ser. I heard it.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I lived below the Street of Flour.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Gin Alley.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,So how'd you become a lord?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Oh, that's a long story."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,You see? Highborns.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Why did you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Does he?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,He's dead.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,How'd he die?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Following me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,When did you come to this strange country?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,When I was thirteen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You were only a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"No, I expect not."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I have a name.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,Why do you want me to leave?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,Lord Varys.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Keep up.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,podrick,"I don't think I can, my lord."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Leave.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,She doesn't deserve this.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,So she can have some happiness in her life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You have children. How happy would you say you are?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Even Joffrey?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,How long does it go on?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"Aye, not for long."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,You sewed it on?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,I did.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,What do you want?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Mind if I keep warm?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Fuck off.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,But I'm hungry.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,I've got money.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,What kind of coin is that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,It's worth a lot.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Sorry.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Little shit.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Fool!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,Where did you get the knife?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,From you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,Is that the first man you've killed?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,The first man.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,"Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Valar morghulis.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I do know some things. I know I love you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,I know how this must look. What I meant was-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,"I swear to you, my lord-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Gilly.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,"Yes, my-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Maester.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Master.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,And the child?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,His name is Sam.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Miles better.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Night.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,I don't know. There just is.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Well, your father's not going to go to that."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Noblemen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,What is it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Stay here. Bar the door.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Aegon Targaryen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Everything.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The boy must die.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,What are you doing?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You're leaving.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Is this some kind of trick?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Yes, but not on you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,I know not to drink seawater.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Where should I go?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,The gold cloaks are looking for me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,No.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,The other way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You ever been in a boat before?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,You know how to swim?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Don't fall out. Go on.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Why are you doing this?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,guard,Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pyp,I don't think he can see us.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,Pyp? Sam?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,"Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jaime lannister,Cersei.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,You don't deny it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,No. I let him go.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aye, I do."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,There has got to be another way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Take him away.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,Why am I gonna need you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,My king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,When did you learn to read?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,"This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,I've made my decision.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,barristan,"They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jorah mormont,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,People learn to love their chains.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,missandei,"This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,No.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,"You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daughter,Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,What does it mean?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,missandei,"It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Fly.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Let me pass
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
