2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What did you say? Did you say I can't?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sandor clegane,"The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Of course you are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What work? . Why are you here?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,pycelle,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,pycelle,A common superstition.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"Yes, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our father is Hand of the King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I tried to stop it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What do you know about warfare?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,You are here to advise him.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,How?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,One?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,Of course I remember!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,I - I believe it will.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,portan,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,Don't have any pain.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Lucky for you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,That way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,You've been having those dreams again.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't dream.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Everyone dreams.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,He said they ate meat.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,I remember.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,Does it ever end?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,And you're sure there's no other way?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,No one will take my dragons.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,As you are mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,You never have.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,This is… bad time to start.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Are those girls?

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,He don't like people messing with his wives.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,It's beyond foul.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,What happens to the boys?

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,We're not Southerners.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,You bring any of that good wine with you?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,melisandre,"You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,melisandre,"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cressen,"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth…"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,What's the truth?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,matthos,And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,stannis baratheon,A lie. Take it out.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,matthos,"That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,stannis baratheon,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,stannis baratheon,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,melisandre,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,melisandre,He has no need for ships.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,davos,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"No, but he's starting to know me."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,It's better than three defeats.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,This city stinks Like dead bodies.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"A bit corpsey, yes."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,And shit.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,I thought you wanted to come here.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,I love it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,And cum and garlic and rum.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You can smell cum from the balcony?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,And so did the country.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,This is where I belong.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,No one will know.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,What about you?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,shae,Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Curious.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Yes.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And which truth is that?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Knowledge is power.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"I am, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"An honorable request, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Of course they are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Men who fought my father.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You can't go to Winterfell.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I beg your pardon?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,Why in the name of all the Gods -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I will ride at first light.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Give Lord Renly my regards.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What is all this?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,roz,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,It was quite a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,pycelle,The northerners are a superstitious people.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How do you kill a dead man?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Apparently you burn him.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,We were having a serious discussion.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,Would you look at that.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed."

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I didn't touch her!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,You don't need to see this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,He is blood of my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Who did this?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,No! They killed his soul!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Is it as you remember my lord?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Looks smaller.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Who will?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,I love the cold and wet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Then you'll be king before long.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I don't blame him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I haven't paid you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,"I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"I'm sorry, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"No, my lord… It's Mhaegen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Who?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,More wine?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Damn it, boy!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,"Apologies, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Wars have been started for less.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Orders are orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I never said they were the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,You know your sister better than I do.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I don't listen to filth.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, we shan't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Boys?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,To the new Commander.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I'm not afraid of no battles.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,They had armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,So?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"No, it isn't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,It's when they've got armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Now who told you that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,A knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How'd you know he was a knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"Well, cause he got armor on."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,How'd you know?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Cause I sold armor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,No idea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,You're a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who asked questions?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Lord Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What did they ask about?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,My mom.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who's your mom?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,And who was your father?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I'm not a girl!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,That's true. You're still a girl.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I am not!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,They won't. Not from me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Do not call me milady.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,What you carrying?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I need to get to Pyke.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,I'll find you a horse.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I bet you can.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,None like you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You don't know what I'm like.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Is that an offer from my future king?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,A man. Your blood and your heir.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Lord Stark is gone.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And how do you feel about that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Gold.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,He heeds your counsel?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Oh, you will?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,My dear.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Yara?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And why not?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You're a woman!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You're the one in skirts.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,all three,What's dead may never die.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Mind your words, pirate. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Matthos.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,That's a promise that always comes true.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Only the clever ones.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,It is. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"One thing, I want the queen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,The queen?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,As if she would just let you!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,You believe your king can win?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He is the one true king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,When will the King have a sail?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,As soon as his God wills it.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Oh you and your mother.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,But you always came home.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,I wasn't praying.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Don't tell him that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,She was my mother too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,How did it fare with your pirate?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Does seem the wiser choice.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"At once, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Come.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,What did you say to him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Why?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Tell your lord to burn them then.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must have faith.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Then we must be the ten.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must give... all of yourself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,I have a wife. I took a vow.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,A son?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,"Out, all of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wait outside.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Now!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Leave us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What did you do?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What business is that of yours?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,You know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Don't lose it again.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Gilly.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,You're leaving.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,I can't take it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,"You, you shouldn't give it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,hodor,Hodor.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,Every night it's the same.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,So she was lying? They don't exist?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Loras! Highgarden!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,Get him!

2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,colen,"Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,You are most kind.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,Your Grace.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Gerard. How's your foot?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,"Better, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,They don't know their own size is all.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Good man.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Why?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What are you doing here?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You lying bitch.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I've always wanted a castle.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Be careful of their nets.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,What are our words? Our words?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,We do not sow.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You gave me away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I have no other family.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Keep your voice down.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Again, only temporary."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Scullion? What is a scullion?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Kitchen wench.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,A kitchen wench?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but-"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,I'm the weakness?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,How is being a weakness a compliment?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,"Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,He might.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Would you like that?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,No. I don't think so.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Come in.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Who are you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,What things?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You said to brush your-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Not now.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Your chamber pot is empty.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Clean the table.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Yes.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,For whom?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Lady Zuriff.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Lady Zuriff
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,She wasn't in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Do you want me to leave?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Just brush my hair.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Please.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Thank you, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Why, yes, of course, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Matrimony, huh? Yes."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Precisely.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Tell no one what?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Who better?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That must hurt.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What? What is it?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'll make it up to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And Margaery's a virgin?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,As is your right. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You look very beautiful.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,It's a lovely gown.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You certainly don't need it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Must be the wine.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Here, let me."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'm sorry.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I don't know what you're talking about.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,She'll be a hostage.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,A guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You cannot stop it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Get out! Get out!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,priest,"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I would.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,Kneel.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,"Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Find him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, you don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"No, I don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, please, please."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,I am your loyal servant.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,The eunuch has spies everywhere.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, no, no."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,timett,"There are no goats, halfman."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Well, make do."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't like his beard.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What? What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So you poisoned him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,No. Never.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Lannister, I always served Lannister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,For your trouble.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I can't sleep.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I don't like the taste.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Same as most men, I think."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"No, I'm not afraid."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,I can fight.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,"Come on, move, move!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,If he ever gets out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Loras Tyrell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,They get spooked by their own shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Shh. Do you hear that?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,No.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,There's something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,There is something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"Yeah, don't even try me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,King in the North!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,men,The King in the North!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I doubt it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,We're not in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,We're not torturing them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"The high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, don't! Don't! Please!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Shhh.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,The rot's set in.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, don't! No, don't!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Shh.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, you can't!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You'll die if she doesn't.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"I don't want to be a cripple, please."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,"Your men are not my men, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,No! You can't!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,What's your name?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Talisa.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Your last name?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You want to know what side my family fights on?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,They killed my father.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy did?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,The family he fights for.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I have no hatred for the lad.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That should help his foot grow back.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You're going to kill Joffrey?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,If the gods give me strength.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,And then what?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,So who will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,First we have to win the war.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You never told me where you're from.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Volantis.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,He was unlucky that you were.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Killing you would send your brother a message.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I'm punishing her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"What are you doing here, dog?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,And? What is it?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,"Look inside, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Happy nameday, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My nameday has passed.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,We won't tell if you won't.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,No. Her. Touch her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Could you hit her?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My uncle sent you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,Hmm.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Use this.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Please, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, if your uncle finds out"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Begin.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm a practical man.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Just not a loyal one.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I would give priority to my head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"You've never married, have you?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,This isn't your horse.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Will they let us in?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What do you know of this place?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Go on!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"You, keep moving!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Bring her about!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What kind of fire melts stone?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dragonfire.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,There's dragons here?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"No, all the dragons are dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What's that smell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dead people.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,Move.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Please, please, no, no! No."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,They take someone every day?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Does anyone live?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,How dare you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,You may have heard false reports.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You betrayed Ned.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"No, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"You have Arya, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What do you want?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You think I keep secrets from my son?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Good faith?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Get up, you dogs!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,"That's him, the one who picks."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,The Mountain. What are you doing?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,You.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,"Move, boy! Move!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold and silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Gems?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see any.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Where is the Brotherhood?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know. Please.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Which of the villagers aided them?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who helped him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"Ganes, the butcher, and his son."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,That's better. You've been very helpful.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Polliver. The Mountain.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Can that truly be you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Who else might it be?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,My own.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,We share a common enemy.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Would you believe I loved him once?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I thought we were welcome.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Horde?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,My name is Daenerys-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"You know me, my lord?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,And what should I call you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,KING Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Might we see the dragons?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I am not a liar.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Our decision is final.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Very well. I invoke soumai.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Be it on your head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold or silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I'm not from the village.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I don't know what that is.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"Smith, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,"Safer to travel, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,My lord.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,As I said several times.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I am a knight!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,It's not my fault!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I only meant I did as I was bid.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"No, I think not."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,My lord?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,But her demands?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Pardon?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Does he listen?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I've lived within the law for seventeen-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,And which are you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Do you love your wife?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I do.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Yet you have known other women.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Don't talk about my wife.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,And you will.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,They can't bar our passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Gods protect us.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,You swear it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And the wording of this oath?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And in return for my son's loyalty?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,No! No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,Follow me!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,You'll die for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Inside the king's tent - go
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I won't leave him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Over there, go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,Not that way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,We need to go home. Loras.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"My lord, my lady."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Get out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,And you want that privilege for yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,There's no time for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't stay here.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Revenge.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,He was very handsome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,No. I want to be the queen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Killed? By whom?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It's wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,I'm telling you the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,She's making wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,When did she tell you this?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Swear to me on what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,On my life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But I don't care about your life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,It will be my pleasure.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What is it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,When do we sail for King's Landing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,That's not your concern.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What do you believe?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,girl,I've got it! I've got it!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,Corruption.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,crowd,Yes!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,He's talking about you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,What? Demon monkey?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,You don't need to convince me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Demon monkey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Yeah, come on."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"Where are we headed, Captain?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Stop. We yield.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Congratulations on your first command.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Come on, I'll take you out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Dagmer, your first mate."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,You're not.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,My wife's in Lannisport.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Maidenpool, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"House Mooton, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what is their sigil?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They call him the Young Wolf.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And do you believe them?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,Fetch that water.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A girl says nothing.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I was always a girl.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I didn't have a choice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,You did. I did. And here we are.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Three what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man has said.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,The one who tortures everyone.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man needs a name.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,When will he come?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Most of them are true.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,Wildlings?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,Well I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Take care, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My companion takes issue.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,To do what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,How much do you have?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"My lord, this man is insulting."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,This is a shit idea.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys. Dracarys.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He loves you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my friend."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,It is known.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,May he ride forever through the night lands.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,It sounds wonderful.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Please excuse me for a moment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What are they doing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Or melt it. Very simple.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,"Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Not even when we leave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Why not?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What is the House of the Undying?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,You watch over her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Do I know you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It looked like Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,In the shape of Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I never knew my mother.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm sorry.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It's a bloody business.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,What comes after is even harder.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You mean to kill Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I swore a vow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I only held him that once as he was dying.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Good.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,Hodor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,hodor,Hodor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,We have to help them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,"Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Do you need so many?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,"Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"So, what does it mean?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"Must not mean anything, then."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You're lying.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You know what it means.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,I never said I didn't.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You didn't give me an honest answer.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,That's not the same as being a liar.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Well, it's not far off."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"Something bad? Tell me, boy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,I know. It's just a stupid dream.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,There.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Where?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,On that mountain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,I don't see very well.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,A fire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,How many wildlings have joined him?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,Where?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,We need to get rid of those lookouts.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,He's the one?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And what about what a woman wants?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"Ah, a conqueror."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,I will show you why.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And behind the door?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And it can all be mine?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,All I have to do?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Is marry me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,That was a romantic proposal.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The usurper is dead.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,I only want-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What do you want? Tell me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,To see you on the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And how do I get the ship?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,I look forward to meeting him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You should stand sideface.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Sideface?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Sideways.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Smaller target.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Am I fighting someone?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Go up the battlement.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,That is strange.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Move away. Stand back. He's dead.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I've taken your castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Theon?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,To take the castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,You went with Robb.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I don't know.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Find the halfwit.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I won't.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you will."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,farlen,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Farlen, you be silent."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,All of you should do as he commands.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,farlen,Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ironborn,Shut up!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,I am.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,My lord.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,My Lord Greyjoy.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,You were here the day I was taken.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Let me serve you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Step aside.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,black lorren,Greyjoy!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,black lorren,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,They are not my people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,If he were alive to see this
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,"No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,"He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,Come.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I'm begging you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,Coward.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Please, stop this. Please stop him."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Any last words, old man?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Theon, please don't."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rickon,Do something!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,There goes your pet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,He's not a pet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Ghost is different.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We could do the same.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,My father always said I'm of the North.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I wasn't joking.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'll gladly give my life.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I do.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Can you read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,My lord?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,"My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,My cupbearer can read better than you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,armory,"My lord, I-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Lord Petyr Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm. Give us the room.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Clear all this.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Lord Tywin.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wine?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Thank you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,What news from the capital?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Yes, yes, yes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wants to be queen.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Yes, she does."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,More wine for Lord Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,They have.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Pardon, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It's only wine.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,You would ride there yourself?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Tonight, with your leave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,And what else?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,A girl.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,A wildling.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We could question her.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,What's your name?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Ygritte.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I gave you my name.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm Jon Snow.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You ought to burn them you killed.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,The Free Folk.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,How many?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Do you mean to march on the Wall?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Do you know who I am, girl?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"No. No, I'll do it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm as much a crow as they are.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Will you burn me? After?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Go on. Be quick about it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Do it. Bastard, do it!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You can't do it. We both know it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'll find them.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,septon,May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,cersei lannister,"One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I saw you cry.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,"Did you say something, my lady?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,So?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,It seems a normal thing.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Is your little brother a prince?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,No.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,"Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Murderer! Bastard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,All hail the King.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,He's no king.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,He's a bastard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Please, Your Grace, we're hungry."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Freak.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,"Yes, my lord. Come, quickly."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,woman,"Please, Your Grace, give us some food!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Bread, Your Grace, please!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Hold on!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Hold them back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Just kill them! Kill them all!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Move. Move!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Pull back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Tear him to pieces!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,What are you doing? I want these people executed!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,And they want the same for you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Where's Sansa?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Through the door.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Come on.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Push hard.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,meryn,Protect the king!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Get back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Fall back! Keep him safe!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Come in! Come in!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,cuard,Keep him safe!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,crowd,Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Watch out. Hold them back.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Hey.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Traitors! I'll have all their heads.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You can't insult me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You can't-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"I can, I am."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,They attacked me!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You're talking to a king!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Let them have her!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Where are you going?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,meryn,I take my orders from the king.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Where? This way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Please! No! No!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Please!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,"You're all right now, little bird. You're all right."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,We'll get you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,This way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,The little birdo s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Well done, Clegane."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,I didn't do it for you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,He shouldn't make me wait.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I already have a husband.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,The Mother of Dragons!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Ah, here he comes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come here to argue grammar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,There are many there that support my claim.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,When were you there last?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I left when I was a baby.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"So, in truth, you have no allies."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,A shrewd man.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Yes, my lady, but not with my ships."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Who taught you to read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"My father, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,A stonemason.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,He taught himself.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Quite a man. What killed him?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Loyalty.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,No. But you've already begun.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Did you know your father, my lord?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,"Where are you going, girl?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"The armory, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Lord Tywin sent me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,What might this be?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Lord Tywin gave it to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,What for?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,To take to the armory.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Move! Get out of the way!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Amory Lorch.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jaqen hghar,A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Now!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jaqen hghar,A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Guard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,soldier,Your Grace.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,soldier,"My honor, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,quent,Your Grace.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Quent.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Lady Talisa.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Because it's obvious.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I'd call you a liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Quite a pretty spot.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Will we be here long?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,I'm not a spy.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The Young Wolf is on the move. """
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Robb.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Lady Stark.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa...?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Maegyr.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I've missed you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"Yes, you look positively forlorn."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I know.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,A debt that must be paid.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I haven't forgotten.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose bolton,Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Here? There's no shelter here.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,There's no shelter anywhere.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,No fire.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,But a fire is-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Have it your way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they're out looking for you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Yes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they'll find you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop moving.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop it!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,You're still moving.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,This cannot be true.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Why? Why would Theon-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,My brothers?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I must go north at once.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Let me go and talk to Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I'm no liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ahsa,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Like what?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"We know things, the free people."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Other things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Savage things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Wait outside.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I always wondered what you had under there.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,It comes at a price.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I already had that.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ahsa,What all free people want. My freedom.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Ow!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Shh. It's not deep.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I thought they were going to kill me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,"They thought so, too."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,"He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Of course he did.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Why? Why would a stranger-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,But you're not the wrong people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,And where are you going?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I have something for you from Prince Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,What?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Where are they? Where are my dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,black lorren,The giant must have took him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,black lorren,"Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Come on, find the scent. Where they going?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,Halt!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Enjoying your first hunt?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"With hunting, there's blood at the end."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,They're little boys.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,They have no value to me missing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We have a scent!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,We should have took more food.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,The boy can't survive on walnuts.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickon,I'm fine.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,hodor,Hodor.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"Even you, sweet giant."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickon,Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rikon,Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,They'll be after us with hounds.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Let's move.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Don't call them that.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, stones? Or bone?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Neither. Both.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Move!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So the lads just do it with each other?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,No.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Never?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Never. We swore an oath.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Would you please shut up?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,You're a free woman?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,It was my choice to say the words.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So you don't like girls?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Of course I like girls.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,But you chose never to touch them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So why are you fighting us?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountian,We hanged twenty men last night.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. Is that mutton?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"Yes, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Don't like mutton.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I'll bring something else.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Leave it. Are you hungry?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,No.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Of course you are. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Have you ever lost before?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Yes. Dragons happened.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Aegon and his sisters.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Most girls are idiots.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,From my father.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"And, girl."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,M'lord.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Yes.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Go on.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Does it give you joy to scare people?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,"No, it gives me joy to kill people."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,It was his duty. He never liked it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Why are you always so hateful?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You are one of the Thirteen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,But it did happen under your roof.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,I don't care where you've been.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Walk.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I could teach you how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I know how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,And what did she say?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,And what then?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She, uh..."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,roose,Too many prisoners.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Is there room for Ser Alton?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Does he need to lie down?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Torrhen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,That will be all.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,Your Grace. A minute of your time?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I've been treating your wounded men.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,They're not my enemies.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,That's what I tell my bannermen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,But some are not.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I need silk for stitching.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,If you need help finding these-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"Continue, my lady."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Yes.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,I expect he will.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,If I could write a list-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Come with me to the Crag.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I don't think that will be-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,woman,"Children, come inside, quick. Come on."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,child,Hurry up!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Try again.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Prince Theon.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,"Who, m'lord?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,The Stark boys. Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,I don't know. I seen no one.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Think harder.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,"I swear, m'lord. I don't know."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,"My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,Send the old man home.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"Theon, don't do this."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You came back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Irri is dead.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I know. She was a good-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Doreah?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I should have been here.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You went to find me a ship.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"These people""?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,They are not to be trusted.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Your people are in Westeros.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,They will soon enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,You are too young to be so-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,And you are too familiar.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Find my dragons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,How long till we get back to your crows?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,We're close.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Nothing happened between you and me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Turn back around.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"What, right here in the muck?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I'll keep you warm enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Are you that afraid of it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It's nice and wet and warm.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Enough!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It don't have teeth.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"All right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Should have took me while you had the chance.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"No, no!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"No. Oh, no."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,It's all right. Give me that.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,Help me flip it over.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,Where are you going?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,handmaiden,To tell Her Grace.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,In what way?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I thought it would be less messy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Wait until you birth a child.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,His Grace was not with you?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I love His Grace with all my heart.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You can try, little dove."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Who did you say your mother was again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Cinda Lannister.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Is she the fat one?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"I squired for you once, you know."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,When?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Bryan.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You didn't, though."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,You really remember?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,When I think back to that day-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,Shh!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You were saying?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,I understand completely.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Which knight was it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,What was he like?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,It's hard to put into words.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Did you squire for him again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,And have you thought about
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Of course. Every day.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,And?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,What is it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,It's actually quite simple.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"Well, let me help you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll only have to do one thing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Tell me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll have to die.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I didn't come here for lessons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,"No, you came for the dragons."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,You have them? Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,You love her.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Where are the dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Will you betray her again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Never.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,The thief you seek is with her now.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,silk king,Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"Without me, the dragons will die."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,"It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,How?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyatt pree,I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You have my dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,But there is no King of Qarth.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,"Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyattpree,A mother should be with her children.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,Lady Stark!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,No farther.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,"Keep your hands off me, woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"Don't enter without an invitation, man."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,Forgive me. Lady Stark.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,What is it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,They caught the Kingslayer.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Kingslayer!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Hang him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,You'll die today.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Justice for the Karstark.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Gut him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard,This monster killed my son.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,And where is our king now?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,You know very well.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,How dare you!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Wise men do not make demands of kings.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,And gag him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Since when do you light your own candles?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,More than we have.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I thought the girls might help him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Did you?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. If we can't control him
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Sins?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Then why wait?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We're sworn to the king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,There's not a king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,That's treason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"So is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Back off, you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"No, I won't."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,So they say.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Come.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,I need to be alone with him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,"My lady, our orders-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You strangled his son with your chains.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You are a man without honor.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Brienne.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Your sword.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,What are you doing? What have you done?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,No!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Riders approaching!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,mar,Open the gate!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Envy isn't attractive.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,What envy?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Exactly.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,They made me a promise
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Don't call me
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You are weak. And you're stupid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,I'm warning you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Go on, then. Warn me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Leave us.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,I don't intend to die.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,I already got one crow. Don't need two.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,And now he wishes he did. Gut him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,"He runs, I'll chop his balls off."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,I know.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,The others?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They died because of me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,See that it wasn't for nothing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,wildling,"All right, up, lad."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,wildling,"Come on, on your feet, now. Move it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Is she beautiful?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I've never met her.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,What's her name?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,An important bridge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Ah.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I wish I could have met him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He would have liked you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Then why don't you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That would be a start.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rider,"Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How? How?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Tell me this isn't true.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,For the girls.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,You betrayed me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rickard karstark,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rickard karstark,I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,"Forty, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Damn.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,You will not provoke me to anger.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,I've never seen you fight.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,Too close to Casterly Rock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Who killed Ser Amory?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,I don't know! Please!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,"I told you, I don't know. Please."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rorge,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,How would I know?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,On patrol. Let go of my ears.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,What do you want with him anyway?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They'll never trust me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,They might. If you do what needs to be done.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,"I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,"He's not yours to kill, crow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Do you have to do that here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I like to keep me hands clean.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Stannis will be here any day.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,And one of these explains how to beat him?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,For questioning?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We talked about this.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We could throw books at his men.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,We don't have that many books.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"We don't have that many men, either."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,What do we have?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Pig shit.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,You lack imagination.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,Where do you think Jon is right now?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,eddision,So did his father.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,What in seven hells is that?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Look.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,"If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,It's been here a long time.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Dragonglass?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,The maesters call it obsidian.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Why would a brother hide it here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,Mind where you're going.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'm sorry. I'll-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Where were you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A man has patrol duty.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,This a man cannot do.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,You promised you'd help me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl gives a man his own name?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,That's right.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Un-name me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,No.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Please?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'll un-name you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Thank you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,If you help me and my friends escape.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,A girl will obey.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Thank you, Podrick."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Odd little boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You and Varys both.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's only a boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's not ready.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because he doesn't have a cock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Neither do you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,It's not that little.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Why are you smiling?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I'm happy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And why are you happy?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I have your little whore.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I thought you preferred blondes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Why do you care who I fuck?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Where did you find her?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I promise I will free you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ros,Don't forget me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Never.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Get out.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Shae!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're beautiful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,Then why do you look sad?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We have to be more careful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,There are people who want to hurt me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I'm yours.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Promise me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I'm yours and you are mine.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Still no word?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,My lady.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,How are you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,You have every right. You're a king.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,What kind do you want to be?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"No. No, you would not."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Shut up.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,"Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Shut up. What did you bring?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Shut up. What did you bring?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What did he want us to do about those guards?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What about the guards?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,He didn't say anything about the guards.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,We have to trust him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,I want to go back to the kitchens.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Arry, don't."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Away! Reset!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Will it hold?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,"Again, pull!"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"I thank you, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Do you? Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,My father was a crabber.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,Some are happy to do it to my face.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,He was only a boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,I was relieved they did not.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Imagine Stannis' terror.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,I am trying.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"I wish we could, too."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What do you want? Tell me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,A most highborn plumber.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I do. Last thing I expected.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,And you play it well.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We should sail there immediately.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One game at a time, my friend."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Astapor?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,We cannot stay here.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,We should bury them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,What's this?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,"His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,You're right so far.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,Must have been the farmer's boys.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,That's it. The tide's against us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,You're coming home.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Gods be good.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,But not over them?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Are you afraid, my lion?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I won't let them hurt you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,It is now.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Your words are always wise and measured.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You brought me something?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I know what ten drops will bring.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"Your Grace, if I may ask-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,Yes. A siege is very-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,Your Grace.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,To the boys!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Drunk Lannisters.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,You've got a pretty voice.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Thank you very much.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,Oh.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,Poor nose.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I don't think he likes me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,You think you're a hard man?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I know it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Only smaller.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,And quicker. Eh?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Aye I expect he will someday.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Here we are.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,A wedding.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Do you trust him?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oddly enough, I do."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Good.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,The map you asked for.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm not."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,What of it?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't believe you have."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,They're welcoming the new king.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,Drums!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,The ships are in the bay.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,They must be far enough in-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't get killed.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Nor you, my friend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Oh, are we friends now?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Enhances it, really."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Been spending time with fancy folks.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Shae.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Sansa.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Sansa, come here."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Will you?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Just as I pray for the king's.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Stay safe, my lady."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"And you, my lion."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Will you slay him yourself?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Some of those boys will never come back.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Shh. Come, my lady."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Where's our fleet?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,On the way.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,The king has asked you a question.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Where are their ships?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Maybe.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I doubt it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Maybe she's jealous of you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Why would she be jealous?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Sansa.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Yes.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What's he doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,But we have guards to defend us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,gold cloak,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You said he was here to protect us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There they are.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Archers to their marks.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,"Archers, to your marks!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Archers! Nock your arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Nock arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Hold fast.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Hold fast!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Boulders ready!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,There's only one ship.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Nock and set!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Draw! Hold.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Hold.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,There's no one on board.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,More rocks coming up!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Matthos! Get down!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Prepare to land.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Your Grace.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,The dwarf has played his little trick.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,The wildfire.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,He can only play it once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,"We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Thousands.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Come with me and take this city!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,My queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Praying.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Oh. On all of us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even me?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Of course, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey is my-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,One for her.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Here. Sit. Drink.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,And if the city should fall?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Rain fire on them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Archers!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There are too many.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"Pull, pull! Go!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Nock! Draw!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Draw! Draw!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Kill the Lannisters!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Loose! Loose!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Form the line!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You were Robert's queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Pretty.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,When did you leave Lorath?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Shae, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Tell us a story, Shae."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"When I was thireen, I-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Your Grace!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What news?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back inside at once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Your Grace-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,The king's presence is good for morale.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back to his chambers now.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Not here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"No, but I-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Now!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Help me!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Fall back! Fall back!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Get the ladders up!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Someone bring me a drink.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Eat shit, dwarf."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Loose!

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"All right, get up!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Clear!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Forward!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Forward ladders!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave! Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What would you have me do?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"She did not say, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,All men to the battlements!

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,We need more arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Who are we fighting for?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Who leads us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Yes.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,What are you talking about?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave! Heave! Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is my son?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,I want to escort him back to the battle.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Now listen to me-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,all,"Save our sons from war, we pray."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Come with me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I need to say goodbye to someone.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,No one is raping me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Go. Run.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,The lady is starting to panic.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What are you doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Not here for long. I'm going.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Where?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What about the king?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,He can die just fine on his own.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You won't hurt me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Roll it over!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,all,Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh, fuck me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,They're still fighting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,The Kingswood?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,Like what?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Like stags.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And wolves.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,podrick,My lord.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,Ser Loras Tyrell.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,loras,"Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,margaery tyrell,"With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,cersei lannister,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,crowd,Margaery! We want Margaery!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,pycelle,"Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,joffrey lannister,"The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sansa stark,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sansa stark,"But, if he's not marrying me-"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sansa stark,King's Landing is my home now.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,"That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"No need for that, my dear."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,You sure? Most men like what they see.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I'm not like most men.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,That's what most men say.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,"If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,Have we met?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,I meet a lot of men.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,"You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,I know who you are.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,How do you know about that?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I thought you said you knew who I was.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,I'm afraid of him.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Walk.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,One or two tried.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Not interested.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,What are you doing?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Burying them.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I didn't leave it here.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I had me dagger.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Untie me. Now!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Traveling a prisoner.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,You're a woman. A woman!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"Well, fuck me!"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,If you've quite finished up-
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"All right, we'll be going."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,The Starks.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,What did he do?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"No, stealing is a crime."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Where are you taking him?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,To Riverrun.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Why Riverrun?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Why not kill him?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,For stealing a pig?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Sending him with you? How important could he be?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"All right, have it your way, my lady."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Do I know you?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Have you been to Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,No.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Then you don't know me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Is it near Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I've never been there.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,What do you think of these beauties?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"Two of them we did, yeah."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Two quick deaths.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Those were Stark men.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I know that.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,And you mean to do it anyway?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I love her.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,I know that seems important to you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,It is important to me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,l I did. I still see it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You claimed to speak for a god.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You talk about war as if you understand it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,I've been fighting far longer than you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Have you? Show me how you fight.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Show me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Inside you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I murdered my brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,He wasn't your brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Let me show you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,"Look into the fire, my king. Look."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I see fire.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,"Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Yes.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,They want you to know you're surrounded.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,No word from my father?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,No.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,Send more ravens.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,You killed all the ravens.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,The first time I saw Winterfell-
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."

We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,dagmer,It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,What is this? What are you doing?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,dagmer,Let's go home.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Come on.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Why should I believe you?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Why would I lie about it?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,To create strife between my sister and me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,podrick,"No, my lord."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Then my hill tribesmen.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Come along now, Podrick."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,My love.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,You are a mess.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,You think I'm here for money?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,"Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,"Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,What would we do in Pentos?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,"Eat, drink, fuck, live."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,I want to go with you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,"So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,daenerys targaryen,Let them try.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,daenerys targaryen,Is this a riddle?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jorah mormont,Khaleesi! Khaleesi!

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,"No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,"Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,My dancing master was from Braavos.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,"To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,"I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,What is it?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,A coin of great value.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,Could it buy a horse?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,It is not meant for the buying of horses.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,Then what good is it?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,"If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, ""Valar Morghulis."""

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,osha,North's the wrong way. And mother and brother are south. We don't know where.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,bran stark,I don't want to leave you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,osha,I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,I don't want milk of the poppy.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Do it quickly.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,drogo,Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,daenerys targaryen,That sounds like something you would do.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,drogo,"Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,drogo,You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.
