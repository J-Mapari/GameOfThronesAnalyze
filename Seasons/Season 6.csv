2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,No
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,He heard me
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,Maybe Maybe he heard the wind
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,The past is already written The ink is dry
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,What's in that tower? I want to go back there
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,"I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,"You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,So why did you?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,I was waiting for you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,I don't want to be you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,"I don't blame you You won't be here forever You won't be an old man in a tree But before you leave, you must learn"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,Learn what?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,threeeyed raven,Everything
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bloodrider,"Hey, Great Khaleesi Move your ass"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,khal moro,"Welcome home, Khaleesi"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki woman,Go
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,We know who you are I remember you eating the stallion's heart Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,"You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn't I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You're young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,"Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I don't know how you stand it in all that leather
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,If we could have the room
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,woman,"If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I am not a torturer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though it so often is what people deserve
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,"Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,"If I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,That's good That's very good
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Who said this?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,Games are for children
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"There, that's a start"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Only the girls
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,We do not drink
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Until you do
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you took your time"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,You found out?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,"We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You may be right
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,So we will fight them?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Possibly
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Possibly?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,It's a conversation
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,Better

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,No one's seen him
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,And no one will That worked out rather nicely
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,little bird,Will Lord Varys ever come back?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,I don't think so Do you miss him?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,little bird,He was nice
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,He called us his little birds He gave us sweets
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,It's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,Run along now
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Varys's little birds
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Your little birds now, your Grace"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Oh, a number of things"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,He understands well enough
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Not yet
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He's arrogant, dangerous You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,Can I help you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Why are you here

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,lady olenna,"I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen's imprisonment"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,lady olenna,Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because you're not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,"No, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"Oh, your Grace"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace That's not possible Not yet"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,When will it be possible?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,When she's fully atoned for her sins
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,You've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I am the king
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,You are
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,And what does that mean to you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,Yes
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It's a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,Of course
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,Please
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There's so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,That's a short list That can't be everyone you want to kill
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Are you sure you're not forgetting someone
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,Which name would you like a girl to speak?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaqen hghar,"If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,What does that mean?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,"But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,Do not use me for your lies
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Those men respect you
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,For a short time
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,Seven years is not a short time for a slave
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You are wrong to trust these men
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daario,You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,I'm fine

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daario,We'll all disappoint her before long

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daario,Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lhazareen woman,"Yes, too bad"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lhazareen woman,Is it true you have three dragons?

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Quality takes time
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Yes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,You know
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Septa Unella reads it to me At me
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,So what did you do?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Come, let's go and see him"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Who?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,Your brother
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,enters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Loras. Loras.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I can't stay strong. I never was strong.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I don't care about that.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I just want it to stop. Help me.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,All right.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycelle,"And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,enters the room
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycelle,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Leave.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Is this a Small Council meeting?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,"Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,Your Grace.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,"PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"As have we all, unfortunately."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,"You don't like Margaery, do you?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You've spoken with him?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevin,and LADY OLENNA stand up.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,"Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,I agree.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"No, but if the king should call on me --"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,Of course I want him back.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,"They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I escaped.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,I can't hear you.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,"You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."

2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,Save my father.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,"Save him, please."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,"Good people, you may all relax. My father's friend shall be spared the —"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,"Father! No! Oh, father."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you'll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life. And he's give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,You'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,It's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,"You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,I had two lines.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,I rang very false?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,You weren't complaining about me last night.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,"I'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,Of course we're going to be intimate.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,It's only a matter of time.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,To our children.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,May they have your talent.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,And your filthy mind.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A girl is not ready.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,She's a good actress.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,So a man has heard.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,Seems like a decent woman.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,No. Who wants her dead?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,That does not matter. The price was paid.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,A girl has decided.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A servant does not ask questions.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,No! No! No!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,It was you. You made the White Walkers.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,From whom?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,From you. From men.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,We've never had a queen. Not once.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,Aye!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,We are a sea people.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,Our god is a sea god.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,You shall not be queen!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I am not finished!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon's own male heir has returned."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,"And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is a reaver!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is a warrior!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is ironborn!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I'm Euron Greyjoy.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I claim the Salt Throne.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Niece.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Nephew. Little Theon.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"When did you return, Uncle?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,"That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,And how will she do that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,"Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aerson,Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,What is dead may never die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,What is dead may never die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,They stole our best ships.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Won't be enough to save them.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,You must send me away.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,Is there a cure?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,How long does it take?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,"Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,"Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,None.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,"Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,For now.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,For now is the best we get in our profession.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,It's not enough.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,missandei,The people know who brought them freedom.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Who said anything about “him”?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Welcome to Meereen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,She did indeed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,I'd settle for obeyed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That sounds most excellent --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,What?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,"He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,He touched you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,"I don't know. He was close, but --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,He knows you are here. He'll come for you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,But he can't get in.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,"He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,The time has come.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,The time for what?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,For you to become me.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,But am I ready?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,No.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"Precious little, my lady."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"No, but I do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,How do you know that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"I've sworn to protect you, my lady."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,What is it?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,I don't like leaving you here alone.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,With Jon?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,New dress?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I made it myself. Do you like it?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Good, because I made this for you."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"Thank you, Sansa."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You're welcome.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,I'll do my best.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,Good luck.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,I'm not the Lord Comman --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,"Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn't a cave."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Eat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Get Bran and run!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Help me!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,rickard,Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young ned,"Yes, Father."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,rickard,"But if you have to fight, win."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran! Bran, wake up!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, we're all going to die!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up! We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Warg into Hodor now!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,"Listen to your friend, Brandon."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Summer!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Go. Go!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,The time has come. Leave me.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,What are you doing?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Go!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Hodor, hurry!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,,Wylis! What's the matter?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Meera. They found us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,I'm so sorry.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,"Come with me, now."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,The dead don't rest.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,It's so green.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,That's not any better being a nervous mute.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,That Little Sam is your baby.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What did you tell your family about me?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I told them I met you in the North.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Did you tell them how far north?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I think we're here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Sam. Oh, Sam."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, hello, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,I never thought I'd see you again. You look wonderful.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Oh.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"That's enough, Talla."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Oh, my. You are lovely."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Hello, little one. It's me, your grandmother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,May I hold him?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"Yes, of course."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"You have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Where is Father? And Dickon?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,"Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Is there no other way?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,You're afraid for her?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"No, Your Grace."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I've missed you. More than you could know.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"Yes, a few times. Have you?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,You think I'm mad. I sound mad.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"No. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I don't understand.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,What about Loras?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,It's hard to walk in this.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,"Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,That's enough of that.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Not fat enough already?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,I read your letter. You're to be a maester.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,There's no such thing.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,The Night's Watch came to our keep.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Where?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Gilly.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,North of the Wall.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,"It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Come, my dear. Talla."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,I've lost my appetite.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,He dishonors us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,You dishonor yourself.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,"Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,First light.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Say good-bye to him for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"You're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Good-bye, Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,We're leaving.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Get your things.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I don't have any things.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What are you doing?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,We belong together. All of us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What about your mother and sister?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, they'll understand."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Your sister's dress.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam. That's your father's sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,It's my family's sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam. Won't he come for it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,He can bloody well try.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,"And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,all,Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,"I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,"Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,I limp. And it was he…
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,No worse child ever stained this land.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,Curse the day I named you.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,Don't fear the winter.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,Fear me!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,I give you Bobono.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,I give you Camello.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,camello,Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,That crowd was shit.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,Girl.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,What are you doing back here?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Nothing.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Three times.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,Did you pay?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,No.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"I remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,You're very good.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,My final speech is shit.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,How would you change it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,What's your name?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Mercy.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bianca,"Lady Crane, they loved you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,No laugh for Nedo s death. These people are worse than animals.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,But they loved her. They all love her.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,camello,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I do what I can with what I'm given.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,With what you're given?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"Well, I was thinking- -"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,Full to the tits with ideas.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I didn't mean- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,You have no right to an opinion.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,And?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,waif,As I expected.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,A shame. A girl had many gifts.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,waif,You promised me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,Don't let her suffer.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,My lord.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,My lord.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,"My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,"Forward, march!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,"Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,"Company, halt! Face front! Turn!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Lord Tyrell.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Ser Jaime.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,Lock spears!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,Order up!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,woman,"Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,What's happening?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,olenna tyrell,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I have to answer to the gods.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,You've lost it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,"Yes, father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,I don't think it's fair to blame us- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,We don't have the men.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,"He'll never yield, Father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"Oh, he'll yield."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"What, then?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,You can't.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,Why did you help us?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,Now he lives again.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,"When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Who are you?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,How?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,Drink.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,"One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,Everything all right?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,How many days' ride to Meereen?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,A week at best.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,And who has that many?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,Nobody.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Nobody yet.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,I take what is mine.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,What was I made for?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,"You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Wait here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,I'm going after her. Wait for me here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Are you with me?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Now and always?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,That's it. Get it to the top.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Steady. Steady.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Up she goes.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Here you are, son."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Oh, gentlemen, please."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Just one.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,He was a woman.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,I'm used to it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Hate.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"No, there's a reason you're still here."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You're in the wrong line of work.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I've heard stories.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,They have.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,They are hard to love.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Of course.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,No.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,My grandmother?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"Oh, this is madness!"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Grandmother.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Grandmother, please."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,What have they done to you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,We marched for you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Have you lost your mind?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,and live his life as a penitent.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,He can begin again.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,As a mindless fanatic.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,As a free man.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,I will never leave you. Never.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,You must.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,The Mother watches over us all.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Shall we pray?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim dalba,"We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim dalba,"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,wun wun,Snow.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Are you sure they'll come?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,That is hardly your concern.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Good.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Never. I'll never leave my son.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Pick the pace up. Keep going.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Keep it moving!
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Someone certainly does.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,"You think I won't do it, old man?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Lothar, is it?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,"Whoa, whoa."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Walder.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,I don't give a rat's- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,"Apologies, Ser Jaime."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Do as he says.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,Those are our siege towers- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,A parley or a fight?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,He's an old man.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lady Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,Welcome to Bear Island.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"I don't know you, Ser…?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"Go on, Ser Davos."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,Is this true?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,62.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,62?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Kingslayer.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Blackfish.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I don't have them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Then why are you here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Or you'll kill Edmure?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Well, now you have."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Aye, now I have. I'm disappointed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,The answer is no.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,House Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,And?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lord Glover.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,There's nothing else to say.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,Why did we have to come here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,I don't want one.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Don't go far, love."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,I'll find you in a bit.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,He'll find us.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,I don't want any.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,I don't care what you want. Drink.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Drink it all.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"You're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,Some bad years?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Are you with me? Are you really with me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,62 Mormonts.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,For fuck's sake.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,It's not enough. We need more men.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,There's no time.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We fight with the army we have.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Who the fuck are you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,Hold on.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,"Yeah, who the fuck are you?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,It's never too late to come back.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,What are you doing here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, we're talking about life. You?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Protecting the people.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Do you have any horses?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,No horses. No gold. No steel.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,"Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Seven save you, friends.”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,They don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't. And you've got women."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You do.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'm done with fighting.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Even if it's to protect yourself?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"You don't cure it by dying, either."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,It's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,He's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay. I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,You're Westerosi.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,What do you care?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,I want to book passage home.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,You? Can't afford it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Where'd you steal this from?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,Why do you care?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,See you at sunrise.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,woman,Sweet girl.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You're good at that. Where did you learn?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,And good at putting holes in them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,And that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Bianca.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Mmm.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I can't.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"Why not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Come with us. What's left for you here?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Who?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,She doesn't have a name.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Where will you go?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I don't know.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"The edge of the world, maybe."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I'd like to see that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,What's that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Milk of the poppy.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I don't want any.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"Sleep is the only way you'll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,"Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,Course we do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"This is for masters, this technique. You're not ready."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,I'm ready.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,He says he's ready.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,All right.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,So fucking close!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,"Look at him. You get hard, boy?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,"Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Fuck you!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Cunt!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"You're shit at dying, you know that?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,red priestess,"From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'd call that a successful gambit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,Would you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Look around. The city has come back to life.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,You made a pact with fanatics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I did and it worked.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'm going to miss you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I know.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Most of all, we need our queen."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The most famous dwarf in the world.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,The king is aware of their presence?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Your Grace, this is not a request."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Get out.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Move aside, ser."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,I choose violence.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"Looks like a siege, my lady."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,My lady. My lady.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,Who goes there? State your business!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,Not yet.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Are they in there?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,Mm-hmm.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You think they're fucking?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,What? No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,I'm her squire.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You must have shown it to her by now.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,She's training me to fight.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Is she? Oh.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Show me your stance.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Why would you assume that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I don't think you know many girls like her.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I've come for the Blackfish.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You're welcome to have him.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,The Tully army.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Exactly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,We shouldn't argue about politics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,What do you propose?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,He's even more stubborn than you are.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You have my word. You have until nightfall.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,It's yours. It will always be yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Of course it does.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,To fight you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I've said no three times already.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Double the guards tonight.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bryndel,The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"As I have said, my name is- -"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,He always spoke highly of you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,He's not my friend.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,No?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,She's exactly like her mother.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,You have more than she does.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,What should I write?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Tell her I failed.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,There's to be a royal announcement?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,There is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Why wasn't I informed?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,Where are you going?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,To stand by my son.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen lannister,"Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen lannister,"Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crowd,Seven blessings.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,More. Much more.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,You seem happy.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Now it's like a man reborn.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I will be happy when our queen returns.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Unsullied never drink.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Rules.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And who made these rules? Your former masters?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And you? What's your excuse?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,That's how you know it's working.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Long may she reign.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Do you like it?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Tastes like it has turned.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I do not know any jokes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Grey worm?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,It's funnier in Westeros.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,"The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Tell a joke.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,Two translators are on a sinking ship.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Ah!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,You don't even know what a joke is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,You lied to us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,I make joke.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,More jokes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,The Masters have come for their property.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Lord Edmure.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,I have your word?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Yeah. She should have killed you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Oh. Oh, I see. You're a madman."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Don't talk about Cat!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll talk about whomever I want.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Who goes there?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Don't let him in.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"He's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,You're not obeying Edmure's commands. You're obeying the fucking Kinglsayer's commands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,I demand entry.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,My lord has given an order.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Lower the drawbridge!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"Aye, ser!"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,black walder,"If you're wrong, we're just surrendered our most valuable prisoner."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"Welcome home, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,My lord- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Your lord has given a command.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Find him.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Go on.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Come with us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"Go on, now."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"We found the Blackfish, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Good. Bring him to me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"He died fighting, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. I admit it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,That changes nothing.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"All right, what should the army do?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,"We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And then?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,Clegane.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,What the fuck you doing here?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Chasing them. You?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,Hanging them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Any particular reason?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,You've got friends?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Not anymore. They're mine.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,It's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,You can have one of them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Two.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"No, no, no."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,We're not butchers. We hang them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,They die.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,We all bloody die.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Except this one here. I'll only gut one of them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I'll chop off one hand.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Bunch of nancies.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"You're getting old, Clegane."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,He's not.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lem,Please don't. I'll give you anything.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Got anything to eat?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,Enjoying yourself?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I prefer chicken.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,You ought to join us. We could use you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,Cold winds are rising in the North.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,And you're going to go stop them?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,We need good men to help us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,"Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Lady Crane?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,"If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,Instead…
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You told her to kill me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen hghar,Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen hghar,Finally a girl is no one.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Perhaps we should take shelter.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,The city is on the rise?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,it proves that no one needs a Master.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Good. Shall we begin?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Do we have a plan?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,This is entirely different.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,My reign has just begun.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey worm,You men have a choice
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey worm,"fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,missandei,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,Him. He should die.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,belicho,"Yes, him."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,Please.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You don't have to be here.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"Yes, I do."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,How do we know you have him?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Now, if you want to save —"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,stares blankly at JON SNOW.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,A pincer move.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Good.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We should all get some sleep.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, for what they're worth."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,He's overconfident.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You don't know him.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We can't give up on our brother.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, that's good advice."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think that's obvious?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,It's not enough!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,You think there's hope?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,You saw these demons?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,What?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Jon Snow's not a king.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, he's not."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,So what do you do all night?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Happy shitting.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I'm not a soldier.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Any advice?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,Don't lose.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I'll have to try.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,How do you know what he commands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Why?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,What kind of god would do something like that?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,The one we've got.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,It was a long time ago.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,And he paid for them.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Not my claim. Hers.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And what's wrong with you?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,I'm not fit to rule.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,We can agree upon that at least.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,No more than Westeros.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,You and I have that in common.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Will their ships be enough?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,The Seven Kingdoms.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,All of them.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And that's all?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Reasonable.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,That's our way of life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,No more.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,No more.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Don't.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Run and fight!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Now.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,karstark,"Cavalry, charge!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Loose!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Get word --
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We may as well be taking shits back here.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Follow!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"It's time, go."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,smalljon,Who owns the North?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,all,We do!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,smalljon,Show me!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Hey!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,"Infantry, advance!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Tormund!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Get him back!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Fuck this, come on!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Their army's gone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Our army's gone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,We have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Where is he?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,My hounds will never harm me.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,They're loyal beasts.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,They were. Now they're starving.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,attendant,Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,mistress,You got my money?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,Later. Go away.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,girl,Grand Maester.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,To which crimes will you be confessing?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,"I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,You understand fully what this means?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Brother Loras…
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I will.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,mace,"No, I can't let them…"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,"Faith is the way, Father."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tommen lannister,All right. I'm ready.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tommen lannister,"I have to go, I'm-- I'm late for the trial."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"I've kept my word. Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,And where is the queen mother?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,Get the others.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,Where's the king?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Elsewhere, I'm afraid."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,What's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,"The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,What are you doing?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,There's something wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,"Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,We all need to leave now!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Loras. Stay with me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Let us through!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess. Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,septa unella,No.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,You've always been quiet.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,septa unella,Good. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Shame.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,attendant,"I'm very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,For House Lannister!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,men,Hear me roar!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,For House Frey!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,men,We stand together!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,You're welcome to her.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Those two have their eyes on you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Not my type.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Not blonde enough?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,There you go.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Maybe I'm not in the mood.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Fuck it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,I'm sure he would be.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Edmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,I'm a bit old for all that.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"No, but back in your day."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Show me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Your Grace, there's no need--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,Hello.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,Oh.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,"According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,He died.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,This is irregular.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,"The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,No women or children!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,What is that?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,The Princess Shireen.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,We burned her at the stake.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Why?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,You burned a little girl alive!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,I only do what my Lord commands!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,I didn't lie. I was wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm not a Stark.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,You are to me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,He did.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,And you trust him?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,obara,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,What is your name again? Barbaro?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,obara,Obara.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,nymeria,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"Do shut up, dear."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Anything from you?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,You're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,And what is my heart's desire?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,Vengeance. Justice.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,varys,Fire and blood.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not coming with us.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Who are you marrying this time?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I don't know. Maybe no one.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,A king wouldn't think twice about it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,The dwarf told you to do this.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No one tells me to do anything.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Don't get angry.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Bay of Dragons?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what's coming for them.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,How did he take it?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No tears.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's not.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, you really are."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's your counsel I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,It's yours. Now and always.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"You're not one of mine, are you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"No, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Didn't think so. Too pretty.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"They're here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"But they're already here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"Here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,They weren't easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,What…
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,arya stark,My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"Forgive me, my lady… if you're at prayer."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was a stupid girl.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,You were a child.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,What do you want?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,I thought you knew what I wanted.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"No, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,It's a pretty picture.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,This is where I leave you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,You're not coming with us?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,Where will you go?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can… as long as I can.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bran stark,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,I wish you both good fortune.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,Are you sure you're ready for this?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bran stark,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,Ned?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Lyanna.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,Is that you? Is that really you?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,You're not a dream.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,"No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"I've missed you, big brother."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,"I've missed you, too."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I want to be brave.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Shh. You are.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I'm not.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I don't want to die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,You're not going to die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Get her some water!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"No, no water."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Is there a maester?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Please. Listen to me, Ned."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"If Robert finds out, he'll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,vale knight,You can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tormund,We didn't invade. We were invited.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,vale knight,Not by me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,man,"The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,manderly,"Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime. I didn't commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,The King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,all,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Come on.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms."
