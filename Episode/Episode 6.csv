2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Where's Bran?

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I can't. The saddle, the straps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,Robb!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"Yes, it doesn't hurt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You don't have the right -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,What about her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold! Fuck off.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't want to practice today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,No?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You are troubled.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Yes -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't like dolls and k -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,The old and the new.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's doing well.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,She'll never keep it down.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell me what she is saying.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's going to have a boy.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She truly is a queen today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,It's not my law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,They don't belong to you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Whatever is hers is also mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"Once, perhaps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And you have all three.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,It means everything to me.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,And yet here you stand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And here I stand.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Noise again!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,About the gold -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Where?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,You want free? Go be free.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,What message?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You wish to confess your crimes?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Silence!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,What happened next?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,What do you think you're doing?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Confessing my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,catelyn stark,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,I understand the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You have that right.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"I'll fight for you, my Lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,It'll be my honor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Make the bad man fly!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Agreed.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You demanded a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The trial will be today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,I'll stand for the dwarf.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lancel lannister,"More wine, your Grace?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, what was I saying?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,A simpler time.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barriston,"It was, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Sounds exhilarating.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"Once, I think."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Those were some lucky girls.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barristan selmy,"I don't believe so, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Those were the days!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"Brigands, most likely."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Wel…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,beric dondarrion,As you command.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Grand Maester Pycelle.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My Lord.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Is it over?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You don't fight with honor!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,No. He did.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Can I make the little man fly now?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My mother isn't from the North.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I'm aware of that.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Yes. I have hair.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,I've never seen it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Would you like to?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I come from a very small village in -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Sansa -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Septa.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Now you are being rude.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,There's nothing to forgive.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Going to King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,And you can afford that?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Some of my friends are more generous than others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll have lots of company…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Let me see it one more time?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,See what?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm going to miss you!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I know.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Listen -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What about Joffrey?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,What? No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Please, Father. Please don't."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Can't we take Syrio back with us?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Seven hells.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Wait!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Come on!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's not fair!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Daenerys! Where's my sister?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,Stop him.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Come.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That is no place for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,You are no king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Keep away from me!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"Viserys, please."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,There she is.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,What's he saying?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Look away Khaleesi.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Dany please!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,A crown for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khaleesi…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I've taken your castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Theon?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,To take the castle.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,You went with Robb.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I don't know.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Find the halfwit.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I won't.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you will."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,farlen,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Farlen, you be silent."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,All of you should do as he commands.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,farlen,Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ironborn,Shut up!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,I am.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,My lord.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,My Lord Greyjoy.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,You were here the day I was taken.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Let me serve you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Step aside.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,black lorren,Greyjoy!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,black lorren,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,They are not my people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,If he were alive to see this
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,"No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,luwin,"He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,dagmer,Come.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,I'm begging you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,Coward.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Please, stop this. Please stop him."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Any last words, old man?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rodrik,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"Theon, please don't."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,rickon,Do something!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,bran stark,"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,There goes your pet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,He's not a pet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Ghost is different.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We could do the same.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,My father always said I'm of the North.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I wasn't joking.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'll gladly give my life.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I do.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Can you read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,My lord?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,"My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,My cupbearer can read better than you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,armory,"My lord, I-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Lord Petyr Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm. Give us the room.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Clear all this.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Lord Tywin.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wine?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Thank you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,What news from the capital?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Yes, yes, yes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Wants to be queen.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Yes, she does."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,More wine for Lord Baelish.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,They have.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Pardon, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It's only wine.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,You would ride there yourself?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Tonight, with your leave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,And what else?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,A girl.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,A wildling.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We could question her.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,What's your name?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Ygritte.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I gave you my name.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm Jon Snow.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You ought to burn them you killed.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,The Free Folk.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,How many?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,Do you mean to march on the Wall?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Do you know who I am, girl?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,"No. No, I'll do it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,qhorin,"Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'm as much a crow as they are.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Will you burn me? After?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Go on. Be quick about it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"Do it. Bastard, do it!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,You can't do it. We both know it.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,I'll find them.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,septon,May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,cersei lannister,"One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I saw you cry.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,"Did you say something, my lady?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,So?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,It seems a normal thing.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Is your little brother a prince?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,No.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,"Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Murderer! Bastard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,All hail the King.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,He's no king.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,He's a bastard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Please, Your Grace, we're hungry."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Freak.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,"Yes, my lord. Come, quickly."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,woman,"Please, Your Grace, give us some food!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"Bread, Your Grace, please!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Hold on!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Hold them back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Just kill them! Kill them all!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Move. Move!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Pull back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Tear him to pieces!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,What are you doing? I want these people executed!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,And they want the same for you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Where's Sansa?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Through the door.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Come on.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Push hard.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,meryn,Protect the king!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Get back!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Fall back! Keep him safe!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Come in! Come in!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,cuard,Keep him safe!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,crowd,Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,Watch out. Hold them back.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Hey.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Traitors! I'll have all their heads.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You can't insult me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You can't-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"I can, I am."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,They attacked me!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,You're talking to a king!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,joffrey lannister,Let them have her!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Where are you going?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,"You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,meryn,I take my orders from the king.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Where? This way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Please! No! No!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,Please!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,"You're all right now, little bird. You're all right."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,We'll get you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,man,This way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,The little birdo s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tyrion lannister,"Well done, Clegane."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sandor clegane,I didn't do it for you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,He shouldn't make me wait.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I already have a husband.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,The Mother of Dragons!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Ah, here he comes."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come here to argue grammar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,There are many there that support my claim.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,When were you there last?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,I left when I was a baby.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"So, in truth, you have no allies."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,A shrewd man.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,"I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,spice king,"Yes, my lady, but not with my ships."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Who taught you to read?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"My father, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,A stonemason.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,He taught himself.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Quite a man. What killed him?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Loyalty.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,No. But you've already begun.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"Did you know your father, my lord?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Mmm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,"Where are you going, girl?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,"The armory, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Why?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Lord Tywin sent me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,What might this be?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Lord Tywin gave it to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,What for?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,To take to the armory.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,amory,Move! Get out of the way!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Amory Lorch.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jaqen hghar,A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,Now!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jaqen hghar,A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,arya stark,But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,tywin lannister,Guard!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,soldier,Your Grace.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,soldier,"My honor, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,quent,Your Grace.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Quent.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Lady Talisa.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Because it's obvious.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I'd call you a liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Quite a pretty spot.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Will we be here long?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,I'm not a spy.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The Young Wolf is on the move. """
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Robb.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Lady Stark.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa...?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,Maegyr.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,talisa,"An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I've missed you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"Yes, you look positively forlorn."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I know.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,A debt that must be paid.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I haven't forgotten.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose bolton,Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Here? There's no shelter here.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,There's no shelter anywhere.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,No fire.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,But a fire is-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Have it your way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they're out looking for you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Yes.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Think they'll find you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop moving.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,Stop it!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,jon snow,You're still moving.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ygritte,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,This cannot be true.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,Why? Why would Theon-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,My brothers?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,I must go north at once.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,catelyn stark,Let me go and talk to Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,roose,"Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,robb stark,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I'm no liar.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ahsa,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Like what?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,"We know things, the free people."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Other things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Savage things.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,Wait outside.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I always wondered what you had under there.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,It comes at a price.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I already had that.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,ahsa,What all free people want. My freedom.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,theon greyjoy,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Ow!
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Shh. It's not deep.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I thought they were going to kill me.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,"They thought so, too."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,"He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Of course he did.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,Why? Why would a stranger-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,sansa stark,But you're not the wrong people.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,shae,Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,And where are you going?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,I have something for you from Prince Theon.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,guard,What?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,osha,Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,xaro,"Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,daenerys targaryen,Where are they? Where are my dragons?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,You've got too much wood in there.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Huh. You know your fires.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Someone built your fires for you growing up?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,I knew you were highborn.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,What does it do?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,How much longer?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Not so far. A few more days.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Is the Wall as big as they say?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,You're playing with me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Do you sing?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gilly,Sing me a song.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam,"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,That's not how you skin a rabbit.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I know how to skin a rabbit.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Not by the looks of it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I didn't see any game before I got here.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You learn how to use your fists, though."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,I had someone else in mind.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, someone else is sitting right here."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Some of us are just a little better.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,Stop it!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,hodor,Hodor.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,"First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,"I said so, didn't I?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,Osha!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,You're a good little hunter.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,"Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,osha,Don't push me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,Shh. I'm right here with you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,rickon,What's happening?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,I'm right here with you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,rickon,What's wrong with him?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,meera,The visions take their toll.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,He's having one now?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jojen,I saw Jon Snow.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,bran stark,You saw him? At Castle Black?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jojen,He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,Your flock gets smaller every year.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You ever climbed it before?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Aren't you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,You kill someone for them?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Can we not talk about that here?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Did I seem scared the other day?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You were trembling like a leaf.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Only in the beginning.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,What secret?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,I won't.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,"Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,"Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,"Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,But I have to aim.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Never aim.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Never aim?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,There's someone out there.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,That's about far enough.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,We come as friends.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,"Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,Valar morghulis.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You are Thoros of Myr.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,I failed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Lucky for the ladies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,How many times has the Lord brought him back?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,Six.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,That's not possible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,The Lord has smiled upon me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You should not have this power.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You've been to the other side.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You have someone He needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,I'll get you the steel.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,man,Come on.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,I don't like that woman.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,anguy,That's 'cause you're a girl.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,"Forgive me, lad."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,What are you doing? Let go of him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,beric,We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,thoros,"We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,gendry baratheon,You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,arya stark,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,melisandre,"I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,"You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,Look out!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ygritte,You all right?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,"Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Sorry. Were you sleeping?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Wa-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Please is not a body part.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you everything, please."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"If I win, you'll let me go?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,The North.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Too vague.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Deepwood Motte.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Terrible guess.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Now, where?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Last Hearth.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Karhold!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,No. It was just a guess.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Torrhen Karstark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,You swore to tell me if I-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,You're right.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Yes. You win.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I'm afraid I am.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,Everything I told you is a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,"This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,theon greyjoy,"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,ramsay bolton,I win.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I don't think that's-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,And there's something else.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,"Not what, whom."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,What?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,How old is she?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Nineteen.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,Could I see her first?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,lothar,Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,black walder,And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,"He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,catelyn stark,You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brynden,You recall that heroic engagement?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I had something less permanent in mind.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,edmure,I'll marry her.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,robb stark,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I should send you back to Robb Stark.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,He'll make time for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,Shall we drink on it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,I don't partake.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,"Oh, she won't be going with you."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,brienne,I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You are charged with abetting treason.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jaime lannister,I'm afraid I must insist.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,roose bolton,You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Impossible.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Why?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Old.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Old?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,And you never-
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Never.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,Oh
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tywin lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,olenna tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,No!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,orell,We've gotta cut them loose!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tormund,No!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,jon snow,Take my hand!
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,That's a wonderful pin.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I'm very happy about
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,loras,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,We can have them both killed.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,On a boat you built.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,What do you want me to say?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,cersei lannister,Who's going to tell her?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Do you think people will like it?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I don't think they will even notice it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,I'm sure he does.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Will they let me invite my family?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,They haven't asked my opinion.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,But do you think they will?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,No.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,maid,"Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,Of course.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,"Alone, if I may."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,shae,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sansa stark,"It's all right, really."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,tyrion lannister,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,We've been here since midday.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Yes, we have heard this story."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,It's not a story. It's the truth.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,Gold you loaned him.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,More than any man living.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,"4,000."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,32.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,None.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,My lord.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,"I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,The war is over.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,Ser Davos...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,Humor me.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,Tywin Lannister.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,How old is Tywin Lannister?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,67.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,stannis baratheon,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tycho,That is a problem for another time.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,"The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, ""Bring me my red shirt."" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, ""Two pirate ships!"" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, ""Bring me my red shirt!"""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,"After the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?""

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,Only half rotted.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,sallador,"Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--"

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,davos,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.

In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,"Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,theon greyjoy,But how can--
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,ramsay bolton,I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,theon greyjoy,Pretend to be who?

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Send the next one in.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Then it is my honor to receive you.

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,Your father crucified innocent children.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,"I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what traditions do you speak of?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,daenerys targaryen,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,hizdahr,"Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."

2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Disgraceful.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Make it 100. What else?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The Targaryen girl?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Conquered with what?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Mormont is spying on her for us.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"How, my lord? By force?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Prince Oberyn.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Lord Varys...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And yet everyone does.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Five years.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,May I ask why?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Most of us aren't princes.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,It's a long story.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,One you don't like telling people.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,People I trust.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,You did like boys before?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,What then?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Nothing.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Everybody is interested in something.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Such as?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Really?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father's orders.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,man,Kingslayer!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tommen lannister,"I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,No.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Not that I know of.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"How would you say he died, then?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Choked on his pigeon pie.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,So you would blame the bakers?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The crown may call its first witness.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,meryn trant,"Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,By whom?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,Without question.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pycelle,"This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,pyelle,It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,Your own brother said this to you?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,"Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,cersei lannister,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"You're excused, Lord Varys."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,One.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,varys,"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,We will adjourn for now.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Toll the bells in an hour's time.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,guard,Clear the court!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You'd condemn your own son to death?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I know nothing of the sort.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You've always hated Tyrion.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,He killed his king.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Justice?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,He'll be executed.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"No, he'll be punished accordingly."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,I'm well aware of your oath.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Done.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,And you have mine.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Not going well, is it?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,You're going to be found guilty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you think so?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Do you trust me?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,jaime lannister,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,The crown may call its next witness.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,State your name.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Shae.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I swear it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Do you know this man?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,How do you know him?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I know that he's guilty.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,He and Sansa planned it together.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence! Continue.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,mace,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,His whore.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,How did you come to be in his service?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Silence. Silence!
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,And did you?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,Did I what?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,oberyn martell,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,Shae. Please don't.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,shae,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You wish to confess?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You admit you poisoned the king?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tywin lannister,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,tyrion lannister,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,Get back to work.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,No! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,Game?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,The game. The game of faces.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,You tried already. You failed.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I didn't even know I was playing.

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,"I'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,Was that true or a lie?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,What?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",waif,Did you believe every word I said?

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,And where did you come from?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,A lie.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I hated him.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I hated him!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,That's not a lie!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,Yes.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,We never stop playing.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I can.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,You're not hungry?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Of course I'm hungry.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I am not your travelling companion.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Do you ever shut up?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Why?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,What do you know about my father?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,How?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I only know what I heard
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,We better keep moving.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",man,Valar morghulis.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,Valar dohaeris.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",man,I have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",girl,It hurts.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,"I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",arya stark,I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaqen hghar,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Do you believe in anything?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,No.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,No it doesn't.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Then she rules.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,water.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sam tarly,PLACE - LATER
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,Salt mines.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,What about the dwarf?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Worthless. Cut his throat.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",slaver,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Guess again.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,"We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,Him.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Is that true?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",malko,Liar.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jorah mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,Lord Baelish.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Well done.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",lancel,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,That's not possible.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Ser Jaime, then."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And if you succeed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,As I said. I live to serve.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,What if he says no?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,We can't. Not yet.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,Why not?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,You know why not. Someone will see.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,"Yes, my prince."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",doran,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,I remember how.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"Alright, thats enough."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,I'm coming to the best part.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,This song really is all about the ending.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,It can wait. Up there.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,That's the Water Gardens.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,I like to improvise.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,That explains the golden hand.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ellaria,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sand snakes,For Oberyn.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Well, she's made herself at home."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Myrcella.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,"Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Let's speak in private.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,I am Trystane Martell.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,Trystane is my intended.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,Excellent. Good to meet you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",trystane,"We weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,Let's not do something stupid.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,No!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,That was something stupid.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,You hurt him!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",jaime lannister,"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,Oh for fuck's sake.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,You're coming with me.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myrcella,I don't want to!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,"I wasn't asking, princess."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,Drop you weapons!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",obara,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,Drop your weapons!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",areo,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",bronn,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",rider,Halt!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,But he was the king's brother.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Cersei is behind this.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,You must be exhausted.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,Beg your pardon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What veil?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,I don't pay attention to rumors.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,He was my friend. He was my king.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Wearing Renly's armor.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Why does it matter what I wore?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Of course I deny them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Never.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Nor any other man.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,That will be all Ser Loras.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,You call me forward?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Yes. We have some questions for you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,I am the queen.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,They are lies.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,All of them?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,All of them.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,"Yes, I swear it."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,"Thank you, your grace."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Do you know this man?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,How did you come to meet?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,And what occurred in his chamber?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,We engaged in intimate relations.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,You laid with him?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,That night and many others.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Liar! He's a liar!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olyvar,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",loras,Liar!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",olenna tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,What?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sparrow,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,Tommen! Tommen!
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",margaery tyrell,"You can't do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,What do you want?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,What others?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Hunt?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,What was your name again?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,Myranda.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",myranda,"Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Go. I can finish on my own.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Yes?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",theon greyjoy,"I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,No.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",theon greyjoy,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,I'm not touching you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",theon greyjoy,Please. He'll punish me.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Do you think I care what he does to you.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",roose,Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,I take this man.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Are you pleased my lady?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,Yes.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa stark,"Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,You're not lying to me?

2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Good. Now take off your clothes.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,"Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",ramsay bolton,Reek? I told you to watch.

2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,I'm so sorry.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,"Come with me, now."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,The dead don't rest.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,It's so green.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,That's not any better being a nervous mute.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,That Little Sam is your baby.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What did you tell your family about me?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I told them I met you in the North.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Did you tell them how far north?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I think we're here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Sam. Oh, Sam."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, hello, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,I never thought I'd see you again. You look wonderful.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Oh.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"That's enough, Talla."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Oh, my. You are lovely."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Hello, little one. It's me, your grandmother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,May I hold him?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"Yes, of course."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"You have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Where is Father? And Dickon?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,"Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Is there no other way?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,You're afraid for her?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"No, Your Grace."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I've missed you. More than you could know.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"Yes, a few times. Have you?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,You think I'm mad. I sound mad.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"No. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I don't understand.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,What about Loras?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,margaery tyrell,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,It's hard to walk in this.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,"Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,talla,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,That's enough of that.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Not fat enough already?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,I read your letter. You're to be a maester.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,dickon,There's no such thing.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,The Night's Watch came to our keep.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,Where?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Gilly.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,North of the Wall.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,"It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,"Come, my dear. Talla."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,I've lost my appetite.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,He dishonors us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,melessa,You dishonor yourself.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,randyll,"Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,First light.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Say good-bye to him for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,"You're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Good-bye, Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,We're leaving.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,Get your things.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,I don't have any things.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What are you doing?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,We belong together. All of us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,What about your mother and sister?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,"Oh, they'll understand."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Your sister's dress.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam. That's your father's sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,It's my family's sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,gilly,Sam. Won't he come for it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam,He can bloody well try.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,"And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."

2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,"Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,I limp. And it was he…
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,clarenzo,that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."

2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.

2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bobono,Don't fear the winter.

2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Nothing.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Three times.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,Did you pay?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,No.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"I remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,You're very good.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,My final speech is shit.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,How would you change it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,What's your name?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Mercy.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bianca,"Lady Crane, they loved you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,No laugh for Nedo s death. These people are worse than animals.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,But they loved her. They all love her.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,camello,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I do what I can with what I'm given.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,With what you're given?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,"Well, I was thinking- -"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,Full to the tits with ideas.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lady crane,I didn't mean- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,izembaro,You have no right to an opinion.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,arya stark,Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,And?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,waif,As I expected.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,A shame. A girl had many gifts.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,waif,You promised me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaqen hghar,Don't let her suffer.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,My lord.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,My lord.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,"My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,"Forward, march!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,"Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,"Company, halt! Face front! Turn!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Lord Tyrell.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Ser Jaime.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,Lock spears!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,captain,Order up!
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sparrow,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,woman,"Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,mace,What's happening?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,olenna tyrell,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,"When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,I have to answer to the gods.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,tommen lannister,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,You've lost it?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,"Yes, father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,I don't think it's fair to blame us- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,We don't have the men.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,black walder,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,lothar,"He'll never yield, Father."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"Oh, he'll yield."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,walder,"Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"What, then?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,You can't.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,jaime lannister,You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,cersei lannister,We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,Why did you help us?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,meera,The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,Now he lives again.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,rider,"When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Who are you?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,How?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,bran stark,I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,Drink.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,benjen,"One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,Everything all right?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,How many days' ride to Meereen?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,A week at best.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,And who has that many?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,Nobody.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Nobody yet.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,I take what is mine.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,What was I made for?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,"You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Wait here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daario,I'm going after her. Wait for me here.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Are you with me?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,daenerys targaryen,Now and always?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Are you all right?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,faces JON and grunts.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Ever been north before?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,Never seen snow before.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You've never been down south.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I've been to Winterfell.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,That's the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,We have to make due with what we've got.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,This one is maybe not so smart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Good. That's more important than being smart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,looks at JON as they continue to walk.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,You sold me to a witch.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,"Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,"I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Sounds all right so far.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,and put leeches on me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Was she naked too?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,She needed your blood.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,Yes. Thank you. I know that.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,It could have been worse.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,gendry baratheon,I'm not whinging.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,motions to BERIC.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,Good lad.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,Your father wanted to execute me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I heard.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,and JON glance at each other.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,Me too.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"pauses, then nods at JON."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,He gave it to you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I'm not his son.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jorah mormont,I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,starts a slow clap.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,turns to look at ARYA.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They forced me to do it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You were there?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I wanted to.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,But you didn't. Just like me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I was training.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You never would have survived what I survived.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I guess we'll never know.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,I don't know yet.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,Arya --
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sansa stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,arya stark,turns and walks away.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You're the one they call the dog.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Fuck off.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,looks up at TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Gingers I hate.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I didn't trip. I was pushed.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Ever since you've been mean.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Will you fuck off?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and turns to TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Dick?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Cock.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Ah. Dick. I like it.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,I bet you do.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,"turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and glances at TORMUND.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,Brienne of Tarth.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You know her?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,nods.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,You do know her.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,We've met.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,and TORMUND begin walking.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tormund,I'm good at killing people.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,You don't much look like him.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Who's that?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,You knew him?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I serve the north.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,He wants you alive.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Why?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,I don't know.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,So what are you fighting for?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,But we all die.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,beric,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,jon snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,That's what I saw in the fire.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,points towards the mountain.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,A mountain like an arrowhead.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,thoros,Are you sure?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,turns to THOROS and nods his head.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,sandor,We're getting close.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I honestly don't.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,You're not a hero.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,tyrion lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'll find you later.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I'm going alone.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Grey Worm!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It's over.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,They are breathing.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Look around you, friend. We won."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,And what are the queen's commands?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Jon. We should speak with the queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Blood of my blood.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Torgo Nudho.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Will you break the wheel with me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Take him.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What are you doing here?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Hey, what happened?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She's everyone's queen now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Try telling Sansa.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Did you bring any wine?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,No.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,So is there life after death?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Not that I've seen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You didn't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Cersei left her no choice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And she burned down a city for it.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Would you have done it?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't know.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What's it matter what I'd do?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Love is the death of duty.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You just came up with that?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,That's her decision. She is the queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I'm sorry it came to this.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,She doesn't get to choose.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,It was necessary.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,And Tyrion?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Forgive him.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"Please, Dany."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,You do. You do. You've always known.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,They don't get to choose.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,daenerys targaryen,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You are my queen. Now, and always."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Where's Jon?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,He is our prisoner.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,You swore to follow a tyrant.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,"She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,It's not for you to decide.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,We don't have a king or queen.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,"Make your choice, then."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Uncle? Please sit.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,"Well, we have to choose someone."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Why just us?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yohn royce,I'll ask my horse.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,I suppose you want the crown.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Me? The Imp?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"Who, then?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,Why do you think I came all this way?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,edmure,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,riverlands lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yohn royce,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,maester wolkan,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,robin,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,dornish prince,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,yara greyjoy,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,ironborn lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,vale lord,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,gendry baratheon,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,"I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,all,All hail Bran the Broken!
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,"Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,And I don't want to be king.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,I choose you.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,You cannot.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,"Yes, I can. I'm king."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,It is not enough.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,There's still a Night's Watch?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Was it right? What I did?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,What we did.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,It doesn't feel right.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Ask me again in ten years.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,unsullied captain,All the men have boarded.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,grey worm,Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"The North is free, thanks to you."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,But they lost their king.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I can't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,I'm not going back north.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sansa stark,Where are you going?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,What's west of Westeros?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,You have your Needle?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,arya stark,Right here.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,jon snow,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,That's not- Uh-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,What's this?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,He's not kind?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,He-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,He what? What does he say about me?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Your Grace.

2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,And Drogon? Any word?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The farther away, the better."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"As you wish, Your Grace."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Ser Podrick.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,That will improve.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bran stark,I'm sure it will.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"In full, my lord Hand."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,Indeed we can.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,davos,We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."

2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,You Master of Grammar now too?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,The strong live and the weak don't.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,Find the best builders and set them to the task.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,brienne,I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,bronn,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,tyrion lannister,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,man,The Queen in the North!
