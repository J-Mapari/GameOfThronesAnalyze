2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",old nan,The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We have visitors.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to see anyone.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to go.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,He has no memory of that day.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Curious.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Why are you here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Kneel, Hodor."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I'm not a cripple.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,Will I really be able to ride?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,He's not my master.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Careful, Imp."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,What in seven hells is that?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,Tell them your name.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,Come to take the black pudding.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"I yield. Please, no more."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Enough! He yielded.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Well fought!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Piss off.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Did he hurt you?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I've had worse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why didn't you get up and fight?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why not?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,The Wall's no place for cowards.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,You're too stupid to be a coward.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,You're too stupid to be a...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,"Quick now, before summer's over."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Come on here!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,But if they did?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And you know these men?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You sold slaves.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Aye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And where is she now?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"In another place, with another man."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,Your Grace?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Yes, my dear?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,They call you the last dragon...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,They do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,It's entirely possible.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Really? Why dragons?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What have you seen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pirate ship?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,A dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the skulls?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,That's very sad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,What if I have a girl?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,What if I only have girls?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,I wouldn't worry about that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,But what if?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And everyone would hate me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nobody could ever hate you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Joffrey does.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Please shut up about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Aegon the Conqueror.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,And who built the Red Keep?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Maegor the Cruel.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,And how many years did it take to build...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,The Mad King.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Commonly known as the Mad King.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Why were they killed?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You should speak to your father about these matters.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"No, I won't."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",janos slynt,"It's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",janos slynt,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,Dreadful.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",renly baratheon,"If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",janos slynt,I need more men.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I will?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Jon want the night before he died?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,He came inquiring after a book.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A book? What book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to read it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Jon's death...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,Such a tragedy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,What else could it be?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Poison.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Everybody knows that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I've taken enough of your time.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,It's a hard fall down these steps.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Cats? Syrio says…
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,He's right about that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,He needs to get his strength back first.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,No. That's not me.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"No, that's all right. I'm fine."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,You're not. You're freezing.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I don't like high places.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"

""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"Yes, he is."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Well… You can't get any worse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I hear you're reading a boring book.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Pycelle talks too much.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Varys or the Queen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Yes.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"As you can see, I'm busy."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Let them look.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Lord Arryn want?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,He always came to see the boy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to see him as well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,This is fine work.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,It's not for sale.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,I made it for me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Forgive him, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What kind of questions?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your mother?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"Who she was, what she looked like."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did you tell him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Find anything?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,King Robert's bastard son.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Three? Four?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"We've met before, you know."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,That's where you got your scar?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Vicious sons of whores.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,They like their bloodshed.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Theon? He's a good lad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Where have you been?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Watch duty. With Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,He wasn't hungry.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Impossible!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,No one touches Sam.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why did you hit her?!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What's this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Please.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,This stinks of manure. All of it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Stop - stop it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You do not talk back to me!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I find that hard to believe.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I know where to put it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,What color hair?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Red.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,You don't want to know.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,That good?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Better.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,What's my name?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Jon Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,It is a bit nippy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I build my own fires.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,He is still the true King.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The truth now
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Arya!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Don't be rude!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Gods, who is that?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And his opponent?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your Grace.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,She likes it here.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What are you doing here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"If that's my job, then so be it."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,As was I.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,And to you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rodrick cassel,"Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rodrick cassel,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",masha heddle,"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",masha heddle,"Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bronn,You can have my room.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",yoren,"Aye, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",masha heddle,Lady Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house whent,"It is, my Lady."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house whent,She is.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house bracken,Our lord is honored by his trust.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,Knight of House Frey
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,If he ever gets out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Loras Tyrell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,They get spooked by their own shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Shh. Do you hear that?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,No.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,There's something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,There is something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"Yeah, don't even try me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick!

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I doubt it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,We're not in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,We're not torturing them.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, you can't!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-"

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,What's your name?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Talisa.

2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You want to know what side my family fights on?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,They killed my father.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy did?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,The family he fights for.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I have no hatred for the lad.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That should help his foot grow back.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You're going to kill Joffrey?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,If the gods give me strength.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,And then what?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,So who will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,First we have to win the war.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You never told me where you're from.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Volantis.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,He was unlucky that you were.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Killing you would send your brother a message.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I'm punishing her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"What are you doing here, dog?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,And? What is it?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,"Look inside, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Happy nameday, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My nameday has passed.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,We won't tell if you won't.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,No. Her. Touch her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Could you hit her?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My uncle sent you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,Hmm.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Use this.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Please, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, if your uncle finds out"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Begin.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm a practical man.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Just not a loyal one.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I would give priority to my head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"You've never married, have you?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,This isn't your horse.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Will they let us in?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What do you know of this place?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Go on!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"You, keep moving!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Bring her about!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What kind of fire melts stone?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dragonfire.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,There's dragons here?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"No, all the dragons are dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What's that smell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dead people.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,Move.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Please, please, no, no! No."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,They take someone every day?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Does anyone live?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,How dare you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,You may have heard false reports.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You betrayed Ned.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"No, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"You have Arya, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What do you want?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You think I keep secrets from my son?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Good faith?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Get up, you dogs!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,"That's him, the one who picks."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,The Mountain. What are you doing?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,You.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,"Move, boy! Move!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold and silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Gems?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see any.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Where is the Brotherhood?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know. Please.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Which of the villagers aided them?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who helped him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"Ganes, the butcher, and his son."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,That's better. You've been very helpful.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Polliver. The Mountain.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Can that truly be you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Who else might it be?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,My own.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,We share a common enemy.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Would you believe I loved him once?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I thought we were welcome.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Horde?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,My name is Daenerys-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"You know me, my lord?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,And what should I call you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,KING Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Might we see the dragons?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I am not a liar.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Our decision is final.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Very well. I invoke soumai.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Be it on your head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold or silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I'm not from the village.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I don't know what that is.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"Smith, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,"Safer to travel, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,My lord.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,As I said several times.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I am a knight!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,It's not my fault!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I only meant I did as I was bid.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"No, I think not."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,My lord?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,But her demands?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Pardon?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Does he listen?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I've lived within the law for seventeen-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,And which are you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Do you love your wife?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I do.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Yet you have known other women.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Don't talk about my wife.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,And you will.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,They can't bar our passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Gods protect us.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jaime lannister,"If I die, you won't be getting-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,"Oh, enough. Here."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,brienne,Stop!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,Far enough.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,locke,Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,man,"Come on, you."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, always in confidence."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,End your life?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Proof? Will there be a trial?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I need to know.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,I don't know. Do I?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,You do not possess at the moment.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,tyrion lannister,The sorcerer.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,Or the shit.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,"Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,We need to get out of here.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,He had no way of knowing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,We do now. We know what's out there.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,grenn,Craster's been out here surviving.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,dolorous edd,We're like the sons he never had.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,rast,"Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,"Shh, shh, shh."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,You woke him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Shh!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,No.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,Are you going to give him one?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Why?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,Here.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,Gilly.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam,I wanted you to have it.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gilly,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jojen,You have to go after him.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,How?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,jojen,You know how.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,Brandon.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,Mother.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you? No climbing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,"Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,bran stark,Mother! Mother!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,catelyn stark,"Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Is he very large?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Extraordinary.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What did he do to them?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,So what did they say?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,They said it was hard to describe.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,What makes you say so?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,His shipboard inventory.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Former profession.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,How do you know?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,ros,Because I'm one of his girls.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,varys,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,gendry baratheon,What is this place?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You look like a bunch of swineherds.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,And I won't see them again.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You're fighting for ghosts.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,You found god? Is that it?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,"You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,"And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,thoros,House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,anguy,Murder is a crime.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya stark,You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"Aye, he was a bleeder."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,You don't deny killing this boy?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,arya stark,That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,"You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sandor clegane,"So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,beric,Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,"And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,It is done.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,It is done.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,She holds the whip.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,missandei,You hold the whip.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,The bitch has her army.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Forward march!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Halt!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,A dragon is not a slave.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,You speak Valyrian?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!"
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,I am your master.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,kraznys,Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,Isles. Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,I am from an island called Naath.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,When they took you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,"When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,You remember your home?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,I don't want return.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,Kill the masters.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,Kill the masters.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,How are the lessons coming?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,missandei,"Very well, Your Grace."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,You heard her! She said she came to free us.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,mossador,She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meereen slave,I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,"I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,All men must die.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,Who are you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,elder meereen slave,You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,meereen slave,"We have no training, weapons."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grey worm,"There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jorah mormont,"163, Khaleesi."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, that was it."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,barristan selmy,"Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,daenerys targaryen,I will answer injustice with justice.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What the hell was that?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You talk to my brother this way?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,All the time. He got used to it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Do you think he did it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,We're done for today.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Her son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Don't. You know what's coming?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Depends. Did you do it?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Well, you could set me free."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know I can't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Then there's really nothing else to say.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Except I didn't do it.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tyrion lannister,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Where are you taking me?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Did you kill Joffrey?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I know it was you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Why not?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Then perhaps it was your husband.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,No.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,How do you know?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,I just do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,And what do you want?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sansa stark,Who could trust you?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,How absentminded of me.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Well, he could have done."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"He could have done,but he didn't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"You don't know, Grandmother."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,What? I don't understand.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olenna tyrell,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Bring it through! And again.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Very nice. Good.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Let's see what you can do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Olly, you just watch for now."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,I can fight.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,olly,I was!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,grenn,"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Grenn and I were helping them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorn,"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Someone has to train them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,Get back to work. Now! I said now!
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos slynt,The bastardo s well-liked.You're not.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,janos slynt,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Name's Locke.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,You fight well.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,"Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Guess I was wrong.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,What?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,She hoped or did you promise?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,And?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,cersei lannister,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Ser Pounce?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Kingsguard.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Yes. But if my mother found out...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Yes? Tell me a secret.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,That's Ser Pounce.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,Very handsome.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,No. I don't think I am.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tommen lannister,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,margaery tyrell,"Remember, our little secret."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,Valyrian steel.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Mmm. It's yours.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I can't accept this.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I hope I got your measurements right.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,I don't need a squire.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,Of course you do.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,He'll slow me down.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,podrick,"I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,bronn,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,brienne,Oathkeeper.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jaime lannister,"Good-bye, Brienne."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,podrick,"Come on, move."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I should neverhave taken her away.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,She wasn't safe here.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,Castle Black could be next.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I should go back for Gilly.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,alliser thorne,"Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Ahem, brothers."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,locke,"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,jon snow,"Thank you, brothers."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,woman,"No, don't. Don't, please."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,woman,Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.

2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,tanner,"See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,I won't. I need you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"You only need faith, my King."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,"And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,To serve my Lord.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Never even heard of these people.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,More than Lord Wibberley.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Not him.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,He murdered my brother.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam,"Apologies, my Lady."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Lord Commander.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,How can I help you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? ."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,No visions. No magic. Just life.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Then we shouldn't tell him. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I can't.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jon snow,I know. But I still love her.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,melisandre,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,Are you lonely?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,Just bored.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"Were you bored a lot, too?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,I like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,Why do you say that?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,She shouldn't have said that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,shireen,"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,stannis baratheon,"When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,Dressed for riding?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I am.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,Where are you going?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,King's Landing.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,King's Landing?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You can't leave me here!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,How do you know?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You don't know that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,And if you're right?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,I don't know how to do that.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,His father frightens me.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sansa stark,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Breakfast.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That would have been a shit way to die.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Sounds like all the rest.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,In the arms of the woman I love.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,She want the same thing?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Let's go.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Pentoshi.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,And he's headed to Oldtown?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,As I said. Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,A bag of gold.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,It was a heavy bag.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you count?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Four.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,How many you think you can take?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"One, if he's slow."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Halt!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Who are you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,You're from King's Landing.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Why are you here?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I thought the sharks would get us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,There are no sharks in Dorne.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Dolphins maybe.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Throw your swords in the sand.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,rider,Swords in the sand! Now!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,That one should be slow enough.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Nice move! .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,Luck.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,You had a wonderful teacher.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,First we need to bury these bodies.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Birds have to eat too.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,bronn,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jaime lannister,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyene,Nama!

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,"We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,nymeria,We may have a problem.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,"A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,"He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyene,I'm with you. Always. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,elaria,Nym? . Obara?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,"When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,obara,I made my choice long ago.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,Thank you. . Who are you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,Your captor.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,Do you have wine?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,No.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,I can't sleep without wine.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,Then stay awake.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I'm not taking you to your sister.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,jorah mormont,What business would you have with the Queen?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,tyrion lannister,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He sang to them?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He was good?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,barristan,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,daenerys targaryen,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yezzan,What does that mean?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,You have made peace with the slavers?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,We offered terms
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,"And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,"I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,missandei,Seven years is not a short time for a slave

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You are wrong to trust these men
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tyrion lannister,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,grey worm,You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daario,You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jorah mormont,I'm fine

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lhazareen woman,Is it true you have three dragons?

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Quality takes time
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Yes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better"

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,You know
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Septa Unella reads it to me At me
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,So what did you do?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,"Come, let's go and see him"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Who?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sparrow,Your brother
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,enters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Loras. Loras.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I can't stay strong. I never was strong.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I don't care about that.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,I just want it to stop. Help me.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,"They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,loras,begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,margaery tyrell,All right.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycelle,"And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,enters the room
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycelle,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Leave.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Is this a Small Council meeting?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,"Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester pycell,Your Grace.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,maester,"PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"As have we all, unfortunately."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,"You don't like Margaery, do you?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You've spoken with him?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tommen lannister,I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevin,and LADY OLENNA stand up.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,"Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,I agree.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"No, but if the king should call on me --"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jaime lannister,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,Of course I want him back.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,cersei lannister,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,kevan,"If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,lady olenna,Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,"They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I escaped.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,I can't hear you.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,"You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I know. I know and I'm sorry.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,Stop saying that.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,I know.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,You don't know.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,He send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,Why did you come here?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,Where else could I go?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I didn't know.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I don't want to be king.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,What do you want?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,yara greyjoy,That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,theon greyjoy,You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,A lord?

2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,The flayed man.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,Does that worry you at all?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,You eat them after?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,No.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,Then I've seen worse.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,You served the Starks?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,"The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,"Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,I can give you what you want.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,Are you sure you know what that is?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,You're a good talker.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,I like that.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,That so?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,ramsay bolton,"He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,osha,"gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,"JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,dolorous edd,Sorry about the food. It's not what we're known for.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,That's all right. There are more important things.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,man,"A letter for you, Lord Commander."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW looks at SANSA.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,Go on.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,It's just more of the same.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,"SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,We don't know that.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,"Yes, we do."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tormund,How many men does he have in his army?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,How many do you have?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,tormund,"That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,sansa stark,A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,jon snow,SNOW nods.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,So we don't spill blood.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,Well… there's always a little blood.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,Someone crushed his head with a rock.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,1 sits down.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,Bring in Drogo's widow.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,"enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,Who cares about her? She's a midget.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,I like her.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,She's paler than milk.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,I'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,Good. You can suck my dick.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal,"The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,Don't you want to know what I think?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,No. I don't want either of those things.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,"We don't care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,"And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,And you were dumb enough to believe him?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,khal moro,"And If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,lays her hand on a fire pit.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to serve. You're going to die.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,daenerys targaryen,"knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Halt that wagon!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is no more High Septon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,There is still the question of my prize.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,It's not a castle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,How about that one? It's available.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,You don't want Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I beg to differ.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Right. Just not to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Stranger things have happened.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Like what?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,The current harvest?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over to BRONN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,My Lord.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,My Lord.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,cersei lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tycho,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,This is for you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Do you know who this belonged to?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Chaos is a ladder.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,stands up to leave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I'm not Lord Stark.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,What's that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,It's a very good idea.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,You're leaving?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"No, I don't."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,That's all you've got to say?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Thank you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,Thank you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,For helping me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,"I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,begins to cry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,You died in that cave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,meera,"turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Hey, oh. Where are you going?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,In there. I live here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Fuck off.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,There's no Rodrick here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Maester's name is Wolkan.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,He's a thousand miles away.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Mm-hmm.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Which Lady Stark?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You sit there. Right there. Don't move.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,You tell her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,I'm not.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sighs.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,man,"Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,hesitates for a moment.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,smirks at ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,We're not.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to face SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,I wish I had.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Of people I'm going to kill.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"No, they're not."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,"Arya, Bran's home too."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,is sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,You came home.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I saw you at the crossroads.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,You saw me?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I see quite a lot now.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Bran has visions.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,So did I.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would you go back there?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Cersei is on her list of names.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Who else is on your list?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Most of them are dead already.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Where did you get this?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Littlefinger gave it to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,turns to look at SANSA.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's declared for House Stark.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why would he give you a dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,He thought I'd want it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,Why?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Because it was meant to kill me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,The cutthroat after your fall?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,It doesn't matter.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,I don't want it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bran stark,It's wasted on a cripple.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I did next to nothing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,"You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I'm not a --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,pauses for a moment.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"Thank you, Podrick."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,He better.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What happened?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,begins smirking.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,Many things.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Many things?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Your Grace.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,It's all right.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The Children of the Forest made these.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,When?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,A very long time ago.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,No.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"No, I don't think I can."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We took Casterly Rock.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,That's very good to hear.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Isn't it?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We still have the largest army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,We've discussed this.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,A smart one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks over to JON SNOW.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,What do you think I should do?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I would never presume to --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,I'm at war. I'm losing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,begins walking close to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,glances back towards the dragons.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Don't lunge.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Up.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,And don't --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,sansa stark,sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,It's been awhile since I've trained.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,chuckles.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,nods her head in agreement.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"Move aside, Podrick."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,podrick,"backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,I'll try not to.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,"strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,brienne,Who taught you to do that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,No one.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,arya stark,collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,What do you think of her?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Who?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,sighs
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,I believe you know of whom I speak.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I think she has a good heart.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Fewer.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,It doesn't matter.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Of course.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Is the custom different in Naarth?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,The sounds liberating.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Why did you leave your homeland?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,I was stolen away by slavers.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,I'm sorry.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,She bought me from my master and set me free.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,You believe that?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,missandei,"I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Jon. I didn't know you were here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,steps closer to JON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,"Sansa, is she all right?"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,releases THEON.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,I should be.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,davos,Your sister?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jon snow,The queen is gone.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,theon greyjoy,Where did she go?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Good.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We are stretched a bit thin.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"is clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Rickon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,Dickon.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,nods his head in agreement.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,And?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,It was glorious.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on. Your father's not here.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks over at BRONN
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,What?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Listen.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Spears and shields!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,In line now!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,"Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,dickon,draws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,randyll,Spears armed!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Get back to King's Landing.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I'm not abandoning my army.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,We can hold them off.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Hold the line!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Archers! Archers with me!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Knock!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,archers,Knock! Draw!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Loose!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Go get it then.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,I can't shoot with one hand.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Come on!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Where are you?
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,guard,Your people can't fight.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,Take cover!
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,drogon,spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,bronn,Come on you fucker.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,daenerys targaryen,commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,"Flee, you idiot!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"Come on, boy. Come on!"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,tyrion lannister,You fucking idiot.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,jaime lannister,"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."

Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath.
