2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Why?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to worse than him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why did you come here?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why? What are you afraid of?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Owls and Shadowcats and...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No man could have protected him from himself.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,barristan selmy,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,His squire? The Lannister boy?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,And because he had dragons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,You don't believe it.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,I have a thirst. Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Pour.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Do as he says.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,As the princess commands.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Do you take me for a servant?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,May I go?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,As you wish.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,She won't care.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What about Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is your older brother.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tell me something,Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tomard,"Yes, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Now leave us.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,My Lord protector.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The King has no true born sons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So when the King dies...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"There is no ""unless""."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Do you have a shred of honor?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,We?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What you suggest is treason.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Only if we lose.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No. I won't do it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You promised Catelyn you would help me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,He will not have my son.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,Liar!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You think he stands alone?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,janos slynt,Men of the Watch!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I want no bloodshed.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Now!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,black lorren,The giant must have took him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,black lorren,"Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Come on, find the scent. Where they going?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,Halt!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Enjoying your first hunt?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"With hunting, there's blood at the end."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,They're little boys.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,They have no value to me missing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We have a scent!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,We should have took more food.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,The boy can't survive on walnuts.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickon,I'm fine.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,hodor,Hodor.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"Even you, sweet giant."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickon,Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,"We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rikon,Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,bran stark,They'll be after us with hounds.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,osha,"We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Let's move.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Don't call them that.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, stones? Or bone?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Neither. Both.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Move!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So the lads just do it with each other?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,No.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Never?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Never. We swore an oath.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Would you please shut up?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,You're a free woman?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,It was my choice to say the words.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So you don't like girls?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Of course I like girls.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,But you chose never to touch them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,So why are you fighting us?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountian,We hanged twenty men last night.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,mountain,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. Is that mutton?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"Yes, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Don't like mutton.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I'll bring something else.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Leave it. Are you hungry?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,No.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Of course you are. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Have you ever lost before?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Yes. Dragons happened.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Aegon and his sisters.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Mmm?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Most girls are idiots.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,From my father.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"And, girl."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,M'lord.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,arya stark,Yes.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tywin lannister,Go on.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Does it give you joy to scare people?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,"No, it gives me joy to kill people."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,It was his duty. He never liked it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,Why are you always so hateful?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sandor clegane,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You are one of the Thirteen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,But it did happen under your roof.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,I don't care where you've been.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Walk.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I could teach you how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,I know how to do it.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,And what did she say?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,And what then?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She, uh..."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"She tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,roose,Too many prisoners.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Is there room for Ser Alton?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Does he need to lie down?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Torrhen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,That will be all.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,Your Grace. A minute of your time?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I've been treating your wounded men.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,They're not my enemies.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,That's what I tell my bannermen.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,But some are not.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I need silk for stitching.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,If you need help finding these-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,"I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"Continue, my lady."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Yes.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,I expect he will.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,If I could write a list-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,Come with me to the Crag.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,talisa,I don't think that will be-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,"Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,woman,"Children, come inside, quick. Come on."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,child,Hurry up!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Try again.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Prince Theon.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,"Who, m'lord?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,The Stark boys. Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,I don't know. I seen no one.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Think harder.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,winterfell shepherd,"I swear, m'lord. I don't know."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,"My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,dagmer,Send the old man home.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,"Theon, don't do this."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You came back.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Irri is dead.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I know. She was a good-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Doreah?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I should have been here.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You went to find me a ship.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"These people""?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,They are not to be trusted.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Your people are in Westeros.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,They will soon enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,You are too young to be so-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,And you are too familiar.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,Find my dragons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,How long till we get back to your crows?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,We're close.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Nothing happened between you and me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Turn back around.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,"What, right here in the muck?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,I'll keep you warm enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Are you that afraid of it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,That's enough.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It's nice and wet and warm.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jon snow,Enough!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,It don't have teeth.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,"All right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,ygritte,Should have took me while you had the chance.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"No, no!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"No. Oh, no."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,It's all right. Give me that.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,Help me flip it over.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,Where are you going?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,handmaiden,To tell Her Grace.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,shae,You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,In what way?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I thought it would be less messy.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Wait until you birth a child.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,His Grace was not with you?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,I love His Grace with all my heart.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,sansa stark,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"You can try, little dove."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Who did you say your mother was again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Cinda Lannister.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Is she the fat one?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"I squired for you once, you know."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,When?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Bryan.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You didn't, though."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,You really remember?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,When I think back to that day-
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,Shh!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You were saying?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,I understand completely.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Which knight was it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,What was he like?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,It's hard to put into words.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Did you squire for him again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,And have you thought about
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Of course. Every day.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,And?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,What is it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,It's actually quite simple.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,"Well, let me help you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll only have to do one thing.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,alton,Tell me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You'll have to die.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,I didn't come here for lessons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,"No, you came for the dragons."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,You have them? Where are they?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,You love her.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Where are the dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,Will you betray her again?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jorah mormont,Never.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,quaith,The thief you seek is with her now.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,silk king,Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,"Without me, the dragons will die."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,"It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,How?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyatt pree,I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,You have my dragons?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,daenerys targaryen,But there is no King of Qarth.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,spice king,"Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,xaro,"An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyattpree,A mother should be with her children.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,pyat pree,"Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,Lady Stark!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,No farther.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,"Keep your hands off me, woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"Don't enter without an invitation, man."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,Forgive me. Lady Stark.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,What is it?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jacks,They caught the Kingslayer.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Kingslayer!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Hang him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,You'll die today.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Justice for the Karstark.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Gut him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard,This monster killed my son.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,And where is our king now?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,robb stark,You know very well.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,How dare you!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,"When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Wise men do not make demands of kings.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,rickard karstark,Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,And gag him!
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Since when do you light your own candles?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,More than we have.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I thought the girls might help him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Did you?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. If we can't control him
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,Sins?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,cersei lannister,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,tyrion lannister,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,Then why wait?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,We're sworn to the king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,There's not a king.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,That's treason.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"So is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"Back off, you."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,man,"No, I won't."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,So they say.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,brienne,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Come.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,I need to be alone with him.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,guard,"My lady, our orders-"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You strangled his son with your chains.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,You are a man without honor.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Brienne.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,jaime lannister,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,catelyn stark,Your sword.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,What are you doing? What have you done?
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,theon greyjoy,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,luwin,No!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How far are we?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"About a week, I think."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You think? You don't know?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Most of the time, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How do the men holding the banners fight?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,So what good are they?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,They help the men march.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,How?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"She's right, you don't."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,That rain will cost us another day.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,"Yes, and that is why-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brynden,"I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,"I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,edmure,He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,catelyn stark,He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Attack. Attack.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Who are you writing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,My mother.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Is that Valyrian?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Gaaa.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Gaaa? Say hello for me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Rytsas.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Ritsas.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,That was close enough.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Not yet.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Many surprises for her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I will.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,"What, now? Are you certain?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Are you angry with me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Angry? You're my queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,Maybe one of each.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Don't get greedy.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,talisa,Can you leave the war for one night?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,robb stark,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tormund,Most men fuck like dogs.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tormund,"No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,"I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"What, you're jealous?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Don't touch me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,orell,You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Come on. Come walk with me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,No.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,Has he been kind to you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's tried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"You don't want him, though."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a Lannister.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,If it's the pain you're worried about-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sansa stark,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,margaery tyrell,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,She's a child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,She's a foot taller than you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,A tall child.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,What's the youngest you've ever had?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Not that young.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,How much older?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Older.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Shae isn't going to like it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I should never have told you about that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bronn,You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Your Grace.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Grandfather.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You wanted to speak to me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Of course.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"I have, yes."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,May I ask why?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,"So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,We could arrange to have you carried.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Where did you hear about this?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Is it true?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Apparently so.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,But I haven't been counseled.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,You are being counseled at this very moment.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,joffrey lannister,I should be consulted about such things.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tywin lannister,"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,"The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,Two hundred thousand if not more.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,"Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,You may approach. Sit.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,missandei,Will the noble lord take refreshment?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,My ship?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,And what do you ask in return?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,My life?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,"You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,You swore me safe conduct.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,radzal mo eraz,Take the gold.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,barristan,The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,daenerys targaryen,Find out.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Chains?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Golden chains.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You could buy a ship with these.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Do I need a ship?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Am I going somewhere?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,Of course you're not going anywhere.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,"So, am I invited to your wedding?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I don't have a choice. My father-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,I swear to you it will not be like that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,No? What will it be like?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,I'm not your lady.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,tyrion lannister,You are. You'll always be my lady.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,shae,"I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,What happened?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Wildfire. I should have been here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,"After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Do you miss it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,King's Landing?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,Never had a father. Never wanted one.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I was born in Flea Bottom.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,Your blood is noble.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,"Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,There. Your father's house.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,gendry baratheon,I'm just a bastard.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,melisandre,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"Come sit by the fire, child."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,"Not talking, eh? That's a first."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,I don't talk to traitors.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,I didn't like giving up the boy.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,He's not my one true god.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,No? Who's yours?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Death.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,anguy,Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,How many?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,anguy,No more than twenty.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,How far?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,anguy,Less than a day's ride south.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,"What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,men,Yeah!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,thoros,It will still be west of here two days from now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,You swore.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,Why? So you can steal their gold?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"I swear to you, this isn't-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,arya stark,"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"One day you'll understand, but now-"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,beric,"Anguy, bring her back."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,man,"Come back, girl!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,sandor clegane,"Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,I thought you were gone.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Tomorrow.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,With Locke?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I owe you a debt.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,"Good-bye, Ser Jaime."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Here. Let me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,It will take time.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,roose bolton,Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,roose bolton,"You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,"Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Shh.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"Gentle, my lord. Gentle."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"Shh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only she had other urges."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"So did the septons, only they lied about it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,Where is he?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"Who, my lord?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"There's no one here but you, me, and Violet."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Don't you want us to see it?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,He sent you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Who sent us?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,We heard so much about it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Oh! There it is.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,Help me. If he comes back-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,We need to make him feel better.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,And how can we make him feel better?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,I have an idea.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,"Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,"Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,As good as they say?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,Mmm.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,And why should you get all the fun?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,What? You like her better?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,violet,Plenty there for both of us.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,myranda,I was here first.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,But I was getting jealous.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,"Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ramsay bolton,This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You're gonna scare it off.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's too far away.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Is that a palace?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,It's a windmill.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Just the men who used to live here.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's swooning?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Fainting.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,What's fainting?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Well not all girls are like you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Would you?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,So I could tear it off you.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You know nothing-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,And how do you know that?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,Mance is different.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,You don't know that.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,All of us.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,ygritte,"You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jon snow,"Yes, first we'll live."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,hodor,Hodor.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,That's where we are.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What are you telling him?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,"It's all right, Osha."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,meera,Leave him alone.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,He can speak for himself.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,I don't fill his head with anything.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,So what do you talk about?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,What's happening to him and what that means.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,We're not going to Castle Black.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,What did you say?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jojen,I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,bran stark,You don't understand. You don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,osha,"I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"How is the pain, my lord?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"Well, we've stymied the corruption."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,All the good it's done me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"Faint praise, my lord."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What is?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You performed experiments on living men.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,On dying men.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,With their permission?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"How many men have you killed, my lord?"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Fifty? A hundred?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,Countless.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Countless has a nice ring to it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,And how many lives have you saved?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A fair offer.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Why not?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,He feels he's being cheated.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,They'd be fools to kill her.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,qyburn,"These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We have to return to Harrenhal.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Why?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,I've left something behind.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,And what are those orders?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You think you'll get a reward.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,I had nothing-
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Whoa.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,"Eyes open, lads."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Be quiet.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,men,"The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,man,Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,A wooden sword?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,I thought you'd gone.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,You gave her a wooden sword.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,We've only got one bear.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Ah!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Get behind me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,I will not.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,steelshanks walton,Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,Pull her up.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Hold my legs.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,brienne,Pull him up!
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,The bitch stays.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,locke,She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,jaime lannister,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,You fell in love with a whore.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,It is tempting.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,If he wins.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jaime lannister,No. Not Ser Meryn.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,"Go on, move it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,guard,And you. Come on.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,prisoner,"Mercy. Please. Please, mercy."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,You seem to be in good form.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,mountain,Who am I fighting?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,cersei lannister,Does it matter?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Could be food.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Could be soldiers.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Who were ""they""?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,I stopped asking a while ago.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,That's not gonna get better.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Doesn't seem so.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,So why go on?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Habit.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Nothing could be worse than this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Who are you?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,You her father?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,dying man,Wish it were wine.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,So do I.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,The fuck you doing?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,There's a price on your head.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,He can't be. I don't know his name.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,What's your name?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,rorge,Rorge.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Thank you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,You're learning.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,Rangers returning!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,They return!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Greetings.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,Didn't think I'd see you again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sam,"All right, Jon?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,man,"Welcome back, brother."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Lord Snow.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Come on, Ghost."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,janos slynt,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We need to prepare.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,We've been preparing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,And how would we range north?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,We wouldn't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,grenn,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,They won't stop them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The stewards.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,Who would that be?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jon snow,The builders.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,alliser,"Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,yarwick,Aye.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lord.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You have new clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I sent for you days ago.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I've been a bit busy.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Doing what?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She's dim-witted.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Does he frighten you so much?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Because you're my friend.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,We had some good days together.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Yes, we did."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,What will you do?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,bronn,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,But your window is not.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Don't do that again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Tell me why you're here.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,"There is only one, and she does not want me."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You swore me your sword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,My sword is yours till the day I die.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Do what you do best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Take off your clothes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Oh.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Come in, my queen. Please."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,You could never disturb me.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,Not always.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Did you use it with Stannis?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,"No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,I understand how you feel.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Hmm.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,But that is impossible.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,selyse,Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,melisandre,"However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daario,Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You're here early.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Later than some.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,You neither approve nor trust.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I trust you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,You have?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,I have.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,jorah mormont,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,daenerys targaryen,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,No fire.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,No fire!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sandor clegane,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,arya stark,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Couldn't agree more, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Yes, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Don't get drunk.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"No, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Can I get you anything else?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Thanks. I do my best.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,We're looking for someone.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,What?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"It's nothing, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,What about? Not kidney pie.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,When was that?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,So what happened to her?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,Well-
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,The quick version.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,The Hound.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,hot pie,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Um, you were saying?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,Why the Eyrie?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,"Sansa could be there, too."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,"Aye, my lady. Could be."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,brienne,You sure about this?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,podrick,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Your sister.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,I think I would have remembered that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,That would have made things so much easier.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,tyrion lannister,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,I disagree.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,oberyn martell,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Hello, Robin."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,What are you doing?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Why did you leave?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,It's a long story.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Yes, you certainly are."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,When will you go back?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,We don't.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I like the sound of that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,All right.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,It can go in here in this big tower.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I didn't ruin it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You did.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,robin,I didn't ruin it!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,You're being stupid.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I hit him.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Yes, I saw."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I shouldn't have done that.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Lord Baelish...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Call me Petyr.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"Come here, Sansa."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,Do you know how far the fall is?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,I didn't. You don't understand.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,He kissed me. I pulled away.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,Liar! Whore! He is mine!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sansa stark,Please!
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,"My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Lysa! Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,You want her? This empty-headed child?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,lysa,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,alliser,"Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"As always, thank you for your honesty."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"Safe travels, Lord Commander."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,"Thank you, Sam."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"Oh, and…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jon snow,Me too.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,aemon,There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"His little brother, Aegon. He became king."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,aemon,"And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,aemon,"Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it's too late."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,"Theon, wait."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,"Not Theon, my lady. Reek."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,Help me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,You're his wife now.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,Theon
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,Do what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,He already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes. It can't be worse.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,It can. It can always be worse.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,What did he do to you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,Please…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,You betrayed my family!

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,You have to help me!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,He'll see us. You don't know him.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,"My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,theon greyjoy,"Reek, my lady, Reek!"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,"Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me."

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Get some sleep. I'll watch over him.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,aemon,Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,brothers,And now his watch has ended.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,"Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He's a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He's hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army's out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You'll be my Lady and Wardeness."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,But isn't your step mother pregnant?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,What of it?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,What happens if she has a boy?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,Then I'll have a baby brother.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,But he'll be the heir.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,I've been naturalized by a royal decree of--
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sansa stark,Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,ramsay bolton,Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,What else?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,The Stormcrows rode off last night.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,davos,It's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,"This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,"

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,Are you sure?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,We don't have Robert's bastard here.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,Do you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,stannis baratheon,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,melisandre,There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,derryk,"The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?"

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,derryk,Stubborn little wilding bitch aren't ya?

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I said get your hands off her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bran stark,You're gonna get yourself killed.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,derryk,Roll over. Jon Snow's not here to save you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Sam!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I'm alright.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,You're not.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sammy,Just a bit woozy.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,I will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,"Don't be stupid Sam, you're not a fighter."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Just promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,I need more water.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,Stay. Please.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Am I hurting you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,gilly,Are you sure?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam,Oh. Oh my.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,"A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,13. Do I have 14?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,slave buyer,20.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,Sold!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Why?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,malko,He's funny. You have to give him that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Alright. He's funny.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buyer,Yes.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,buer,"Here's your wages, funny man. It'll last the rest of your life."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Are you jealous?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I do.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,You're right. My motivations are entirely impure.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Doesn't make me wrong.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,So what else can I do?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Marry me instead.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"Why not? You're our queen, you can do as you like."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,No. I can't
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,Then you are the only person in Mereen who's not free.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"I know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Of course
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,"On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daario,All rulers are either butchers or meat.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't spar with me little fellow.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"For me, it's the knees. You?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Hips.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Huh.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,The people always do the dirty work.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,A useful talent.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,Don't you walk away from me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What then?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,I've read the seven pointed star.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Yes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,squire,Lady Olenna.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,She's in a prison cell and there's nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there's nothing I can do!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I love her. I love her. I can't help her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Your happiness is all I want in this world
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tommen lannister,I know.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,areo,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,And more hands. How's Trystane?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,He'll be alright.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,Why is it happening at all?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,"It's not complicated at all, it's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jaime lannister,I don't understand.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,myrcella,Of course you don't! You don't know me!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,He's got a good voice.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,obara,We're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,It's against my code to hurt a woman.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,obara,It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I wouldn't say you beat me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,How's your arm?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,You think you're leaving Dorne?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Thank you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Name one more beautiful than I am.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,"Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Was I?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,How's your arm now?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,And how about your head?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Your nose is bleeding.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,It's nothing. It's the dry air.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,"My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Sorry? Who?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,bronn,You.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,Don't drop it.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyene,I think you're very handsome as well.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I'm sorry about the locale.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,No you're not.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,It felt like the safest place.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I promise you..
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,And what did she want?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,olenna tyrell,What kind of gift?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,slave owner,"Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Valar morghulis.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,Valar dohaeris.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Prepare yourselves.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Move yourselves!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,owner,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,men,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I think I've seen enough.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,hizdahr,"Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Get him out of my sight.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,It's true. He has.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,tyrion lannister,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,I know you did this.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,I don't want to see you again.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,Leave.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,margaery tyrell,Get out you hateful bitch!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,"Sleep well, sister."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Thank you. You saw her?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,And?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Who will stand judge?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Will you be one of them?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,I will.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,What does The Mother's mercy entail?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I think I may have heard at one point.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,Who carved this altar do you know?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,I'm afraid i don't.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sparrow,And he has much to say about you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Move. Let me go immediately.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,cersei lannister,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,end,EPISODE
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,That's it. Get it to the top.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Steady. Steady.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Up she goes.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Here you are, son."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Oh, gentlemen, please."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Just one.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,He was a woman.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,I'm used to it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Hate.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"No, there's a reason you're still here."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You're in the wrong line of work.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I've heard stories.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,They have.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,They are hard to love.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Of course.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,No.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,My grandmother?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sparrow,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"Oh, this is madness!"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Grandmother.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Grandmother, please."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,What have they done to you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,We marched for you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Have you lost your mind?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,and live his life as a penitent.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,He can begin again.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,As a mindless fanatic.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,As a free man.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,I will never leave you. Never.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,You must.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,The Mother watches over us all.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,margaery tyrell,Shall we pray?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim dalba,"We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,dim dalba,"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,wun wun,Snow.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Are you sure they'll come?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,tormund,"We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,That is hardly your concern.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,Good.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,cersei lannister,Never. I'll never leave my son.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,olenna tyrell,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Pick the pace up. Keep going.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Keep it moving!
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Someone certainly does.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,"You think I won't do it, old man?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Lothar, is it?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,"Whoa, whoa."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Walder.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,I don't give a rat's- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,"Apologies, Ser Jaime."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lothar,Do as he says.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,black walder,Those are our siege towers- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,A parley or a fight?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,He's an old man.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,bronn,You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lady Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,Welcome to Bear Island.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"I don't know you, Ser…?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"Go on, Ser Davos."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,Is this true?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,62.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,62?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lyanna,"We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Kingslayer.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,Blackfish.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,I don't have them.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Then why are you here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Or you'll kill Edmure?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jaime lannister,"Well, now you have."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,brynden,"Aye, now I have. I'm disappointed."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,The answer is no.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,House Mormont.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,And?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Lord Glover.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,There's nothing else to say.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,robett,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,Why did we have to come here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,I don't want one.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Don't go far, love."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,I'll find you in a bit.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,He'll find us.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,I don't want any.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,I don't care what you want. Drink.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Drink it all.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"You're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,Some bad years?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,theon greyjoy,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,Are you with me? Are you really with me?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,yara greyjoy,"Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,62 Mormonts.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,For fuck's sake.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,It's not enough. We need more men.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,There's no time.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sansa stark,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,jon snow,We fight with the army we have.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,"This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Who the fuck are you?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,davos,Hold on.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,"Yeah, who the fuck are you?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,It's never too late to come back.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,What are you doing here?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, we're talking about life. You?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Protecting the people.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Do you have any horses?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,No horses. No gold. No steel.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,"Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"I'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,lem,Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Seven save you, friends.”"
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,They don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't. And you've got women."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,"It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,You do.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'm done with fighting.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,Even if it's to protect yourself?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,"You don't cure it by dying, either."
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,sandor,It's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,ray,I'll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,He's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay. I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,You're Westerosi.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,What do you care?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,I want to book passage home.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,You? Can't afford it.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,Where'd you steal this from?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,Why do you care?
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,man,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,arya stark,See you at sunrise.
2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,woman,Sweet girl.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Oil?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"Pitch, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,How many barrels?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"500, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Get 500 more.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,"Yes, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The thrill will fade.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Gold?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yet, your brother--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"Archers, stand tall!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,Cover that wall!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,How many people live here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A million, give or take."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why isn't she with them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And the rest of them?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Including our brother.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,qyburn,"Yes, Your Grace."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,missandei,Why did they build it?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah mormont,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,Maybe it still is.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,Hard to blame you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Cersei will anyway.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,I'm glad you're alive.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,soldier,What's in there?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Fuck off.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,I thought you were dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Not yet. You came pretty close.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,I was only trying to protect her.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,You and me both.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,She's alive. Arya.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Where?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,Winterfell.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,Who's protecting her if you're here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,It won't be me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,podrick,"It is, my lord."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,I'm sure your new queen--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,It's good to see you again.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Yeah, you, too."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You might.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sandor,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Where is she?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll be here soon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Didn't travel with you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,We've been here for some time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,My apologies.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We are all facing a unique
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Theon! I have your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Why?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Sit down or leave.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,We all know that will never happen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then why are we here?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Yes. That's all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We can destroy them by burning them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,How many?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Can they swim?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What are you talking about?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,euron greyjoy,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"In return, the King"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,Just the King
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Fuck loyalty?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,brienne,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And tell her what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,I wish you hadn't done that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I know!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,davos,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,I did this. I should go.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You spoke with her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I didn't know about that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,the destruction of this family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You killed our father
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I have never been more sorry about anything.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I will not hear it, not from you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not hear it!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I will not
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,"Mm, not like this."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Why?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,tyrion lannister,You're pregnant.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No one is less happy about this than I am.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't have children.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Who told you that?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,The witch who murdered my husband.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, what now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,What does that have to do with anything?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You think he wants to marry her?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,She's your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Why did she come to Winterfell?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Lady
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jorah mormont,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,daenerys targaryen,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Jon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Can I speak with you?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,All right.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,No. Not compared to you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,Our father was more of a father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,He was.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I did.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,But the things I've done.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jon snow,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Your sister--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,She's not dead.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,She's our queen
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,She's your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,I did. I ran from my uncle.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,We're done with all that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Who says we are?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,"Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,He needs to shut his mouth.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,Hey!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,"Oh, yes!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,That's more like it.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,Stay down or I'll kill you!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,harrag,I said stay down or I'll kill you!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,theon greyjoy,Not for me. For Yara!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,men,Yara!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Have my sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,Are you sure you want to do this?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,And what does honor demand?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,"All right, then. Get on with it."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,My sister asked you a question.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I did it to protect you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Whatever your aunt
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I know of no such letter.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,You held a knife to his throat.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,bran stark,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,arya stark,You told our mother
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Sansa, please."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,john royce,I think not.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed her."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I loved you. More than anyone.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed me."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sansa stark,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Sansa! I--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,man,It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Your Grace.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,men,Your Grace.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Preparing the expedition north.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I made a promise.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Our child will rule Westeros.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,And then what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,And then we rule.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,Two.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,What happened to the third?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,jaime lannister,I didn't conspire with him.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,cersei lannister,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
