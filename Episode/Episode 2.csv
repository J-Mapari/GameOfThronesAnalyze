2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Isn't there anything else?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Khaleesi!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Your hands.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"As you wish, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,What good will my sympathies do them?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I'm telling mother!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,You can't...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Do you understand?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Little brother.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Beloved siblings.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,myrcella baratheon,Is Bran going to die?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Apparently not.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Please.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I never knew.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I am grateful..
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,A sword for the wall?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I already have one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Of course I have.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Soon enough.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It's good you've got help.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Impressive.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,A present?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,It's so skinny.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I can be quick.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I think so.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,First lesson
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I know which end to use.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,You've said it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I want you to leave.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I have no choice.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can. You must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,My mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,She was very kind.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It was always my color.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Farewell, Snow."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"And you, Stark."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I've half a mind to go with you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I recall a few chances.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Bessie. She was one of yours.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Wylla.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Nor will I.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,She's little more than a child.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Why do you read so much?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Is this a trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Talk to Poole about it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't care about appointments!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,When was the last time you left this room?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have to take care of him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,assassin,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever seen a dragon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Everywhere? Even in the east?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jhiqui,It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,The moon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,How old were you?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Nine?!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Yes.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Will it take three years?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Welcome.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll ride to King's Landing.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Mother, you can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,What about Bran?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Finish a man?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Pardon me, Ser."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,I'll get you!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,What are you doing here? Go away.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"Mycah, my Lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,He the butcher's boy.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,He's my friend.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Stop it!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, stay out of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Nymeria!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Please don't.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Then go! Don't touch me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,It's a direwolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I'll check down here.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I think I heard a noise.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Go!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Where is she?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,She's been taken directly before the King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Who took her?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Lannisters found her.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Right, get back."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I'm sorry.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Are you hurt?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not what happened!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Shut up!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,In bed asleep.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar! Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop it! That's enough of that.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop! Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Gladly, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,So be it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,We have another wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,As you will.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can't mean it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,s this your command... your Grace?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Where is the beast?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"Chained up outside, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Is this some trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He ran... Not very fast.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,It was quite a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How can you tell?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,I can always tell.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I don't like threats.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Who threatened you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,alton,"I will, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,alton,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Safe travels, cousin."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,If that's everything?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,pycelle,A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Trouble with the wildlings?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,That's why they're called wildlings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,pycelle,The northerners are a superstitious people.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How do you kill a dead man?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Apparently you burn him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,We fart when we die?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,We were having a serious discussion.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,Would you look at that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,I prefer watching them come towards me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I'm sure that's nice too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,You were with her? How many times?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,"Well, as many times as I could."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,You shouldn't touch me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,You're very brave.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,What're you doing?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,Sam said you could help.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,What? .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I know it sounds a bit mad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,Sam we can't take her -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,It's just not possible.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Why did you do that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"Do what, ask her a question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,You were cruel.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I didn't touch her!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,You don't need to see this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,He is blood of my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Who did this?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,No! They killed his soul!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Is it as you remember my lord?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Looks smaller.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Who will?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,I love the cold and wet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Then you'll be king before long.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I don't blame him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I haven't paid you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,"I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"I'm sorry, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"No, my lord… It's Mhaegen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Who?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,More wine?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Damn it, boy!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,"Apologies, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Wars have been started for less.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Orders are orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I never said they were the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,You know your sister better than I do.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I don't listen to filth.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, we shan't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Boys?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,To the new Commander.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I'm not afraid of no battles.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,They had armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,So?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"No, it isn't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,It's when they've got armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Now who told you that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,A knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How'd you know he was a knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"Well, cause he got armor on."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,How'd you know?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Cause I sold armor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,No idea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,You're a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who asked questions?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Lord Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What did they ask about?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,My mom.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who's your mom?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,And who was your father?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I'm not a girl!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,That's true. You're still a girl.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I am not!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,They won't. Not from me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Do not call me milady.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,What you carrying?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I need to get to Pyke.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,I'll find you a horse.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I bet you can.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,None like you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You don't know what I'm like.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Is that an offer from my future king?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,A man. Your blood and your heir.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Lord Stark is gone.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And how do you feel about that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Gold.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,He heeds your counsel?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Oh, you will?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,My dear.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Yara?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And why not?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You're a woman!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You're the one in skirts.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,all three,What's dead may never die.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Mind your words, pirate. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Matthos.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,That's a promise that always comes true.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Only the clever ones.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,It is. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"One thing, I want the queen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,The queen?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,As if she would just let you!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,You believe your king can win?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He is the one true king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,When will the King have a sail?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,As soon as his God wills it.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Oh you and your mother.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,But you always came home.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,I wasn't praying.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Don't tell him that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,She was my mother too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,How did it fare with your pirate?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Does seem the wiser choice.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"At once, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Come.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,What did you say to him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Why?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Tell your lord to burn them then.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must have faith.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Then we must be the ten.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must give... all of yourself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,I have a wife. I took a vow.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,A son?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Relax your bow arm.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",eddard stark,And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Father?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"You can't kill it, you know."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Why not?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Because the raven is you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hodor,Hodor.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"It's all right, Hodor."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,He's back.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,I don't want to hear about it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,But you asked.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"I know you didn't, little lord."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,We need to move.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Some good he is, then."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Never?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",roose bolton,"Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,Lord Bolton.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",roose bolton,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Something else?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Have you received any demands?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I want to do this.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,So how shall we pass the time?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,By putting one foot in front of the other.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,All the good it's done her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,How would you know?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Move.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Gods, no."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Shut your mouth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I did not fancy him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Oh, gods, you did."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,I'm not interested in foul rumors.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Shut your mouth!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Where are you headed, then?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,South. You?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"No, you really can't."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,And you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,He knows who I am.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,He doesn't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Make it tighter here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tailor,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Bloody flowers. On the king.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Tell me what you think of her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Who?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"Yes, she is."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Not to me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,I don't need to do anything.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Better. Much better.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I still don't believe it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Love is not the thing he wants.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's too old.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Send him in.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,Lady Sansa.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Ser Loras.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,Of course I did.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",maid,Thank you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You're such a dear.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loras,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Kiss me, child."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"I-, I-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",servant,"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,My father always told the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Go on.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,He's a monster.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sansa stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",olenna tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,We're at war. This march is a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,Then it's a distraction.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,If you no longer believe-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,You don't think we can win?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",robb stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rickard karstark,I think you lost this war the day you married her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"Whoa, whoa."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,Your Grace.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,You've made them before?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,Twice.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,Did they work?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,Which boy?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",talisa,And he lived.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,I understand.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"Well, how could you understand?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,You want to protect your people.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tormund,Shouldn't be long now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jon snow,What's wrong with him?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,"He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ygritte,"What, you've never met a warg?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Orell.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,Where were you this time?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",orell,The Fist of the First Men.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",mance,What did you see?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",orell,Dead crows.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"Hey. Get up, Sam."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Get up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,I can't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"If you stop, you'll die."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,"Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,You don't care.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,Course we care.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam,"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",dolorous edd,"Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Help me get him up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Looks like that piggy is done for.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Help us get him up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,He's slowing us down.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,Just get him up!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",grenn,"Aye, I think so."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"If he can't, we may as well just go without him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,Why should the rest of us-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"Rast, you're responsible for him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,What am I supposed to do?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jeor,"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",rast,"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Where's Rickon and Hodor?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,Looking for food.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,What's out there?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,I'm unarmed.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,That was poor planning.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,My sister carries the weapons.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,I'm better with them. Drop the spear.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Drop it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,You must be SUMMER.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,I'm just trying to understand.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Would you please shut up about it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,I'm not listening.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Shut up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,But you could have ended the war.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Where are we going?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,North.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Maybe we already passed it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,Could be a minstrel.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,A lion still has claws...
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hot pie,"A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Shh.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Loose a few more shafts.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Don't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Put the sword down, girl."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,Generous.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,What friends?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Who are you?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,"No, who do you fight for?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",hot pie,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Here's the thing, fat"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,Half the country's starving and look at this one.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,My lion.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I don't know her name.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,How do you know her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,She's a whore.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,You fucked her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,And was she good? Did you like her?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,We have to protect her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,You pervert. You want her? This child?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,But you are.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,"Hmm, yes."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",shae,Now do you think I'm cruel?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",tyrion lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",guard,"Lady Tyrell, my king."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Send her in.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You failed to do this.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,What makes you say this?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,"No, he was a known degenerate."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,You are the king.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Yes. I am.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,The bolt goes here.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,And then you just aim and-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,It's not unheard of.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,My father would never let me before-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,May I? Please.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",joffrey lannister,Yes.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",margaery tyrell,Would you like to watch me?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Tell us the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,About what?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I don't know what you want.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I want the truth.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,What truth?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Why'd you take Winterfell?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I took it to-I took it-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Who gave the orders?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,No one. I took it on my own.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Why?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,What were you going to do once you took it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Hold it. Rule it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,Good. That's very good.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Why did you do that?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",torturer,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,What are you doing?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay bolton,Your sister sent me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,Yara?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",ramsay bolton,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",theon greyjoy,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Rickon, stay with us."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Only when I'm asleep.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,A three-eyed raven?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,You've seen it?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Does it have anything to do with warging?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,What's he telling him?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Why don't you ask?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Where's the shame in that?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",osha,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",meera,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,"You have the sight, too?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Yeah.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",bran stark,What else have you seen?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jojen,Only one thing that matters-you.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,I don't drink ale.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,Yeah!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,We're not children.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",gendry baratheon,That's because he's twice as good.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Aha! A smith and a salesman.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,Gendry stole us weapons.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,My brothers taught me.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",men,Ooh!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,To your brothers!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",arya stark,You'll free us?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,I gave you my word.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,"Hey, hey."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",anguy,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",thoros,"A pretty prize, lads."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",men,Yeah!
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,Girl.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sandor clegane,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,"Silence, Kingslayer."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Good luck.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Be quick about it.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I need to rest.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Get up.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",brienne,Get up now.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,You sure he's the one?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",man,"That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,Give the man his silver.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",locke,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy! Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,There you are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,"I can't see her, Ramsay."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Tansy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,Where is she?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,I only wounded her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"A fine shot, master. My lady."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"Please, my lord. It hurts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,Why? I did whatever you asked.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,myranda,Me jealous of her?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tansy,"My lord, please."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Not so pretty now.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,Is it solid gold?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Gilded steel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Oh!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,I'll clean it up.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"No, I'll do it. Leave us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,It's only wine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I can't fight anymore.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,What about your left?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Is this place safe?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Uh-huh.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Best time to attack a man.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,Plan on growing it back?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Come on, then."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Open the gates!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father. Welcome home.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"A pleasure, Mother."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,walda,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,woman,"This way, my lady."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,Where is your prize?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Father.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,What did you do to him?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You flayed him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,I placed far too much trust in you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,Give him the razor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"I don't know, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,And crisped them so no one would know.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,You ready for a hunt?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meryn trant,Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,theon greyjoy,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,locke,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ramsay bolton,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,roose,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"Oh, to be foreign."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Ahem.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,varys,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,"From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,mace,"I shall be honored, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A book?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,So they say.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Stormbringer.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Terminus.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Widow's Wail.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,Wolfsbane.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,"You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Don't call me that.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What should I call you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,Our friendship?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What is this?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,She doesn't want you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need to do right by her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,You don't want her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,By our children.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,What are you afraid of?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I'm not afraid.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I need you to leave.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,"We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shae,How many whores have you been with?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,"Sire, I served you well."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, show us the way..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,"Selyse, you're my sister!"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Yours are the stars that guide us.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,axell florent,Tell him! Tell him!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,He was an infidel.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,A good deal more than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,davos,"I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Meat's off.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Our larders are almost empty.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,You hate fish.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,Of course I remember.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,It's all I knew when I was a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,Until you found the Lord of Light?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Until he found me.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,I fear for our daughter's soul.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,She's a stubborn little beast.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's a child.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,selyse,As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Come in.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,I heard it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,And it frightened you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,But they screamed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,And you didn't have this.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,"I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,shireen,There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,melisandre,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,hodor,Hodor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,Why did you wake me?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,You've been gone for hours.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I was hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,We're all hungry.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I was just eating.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jojen,"Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,meera,"You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,"Hodor, take me to the tree."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,threeeyed raven,Look for me... beneath the tree.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,threeeyed raven,North.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bran stark,I know where we have to go.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,septon,"Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"With this kiss, I pledge my love."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,sansa stark,We have a new queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Better her than you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,It feels proportionate.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Proportionate to what?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,The expected extravagance.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,All taken care of.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw her board the ship?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Aye, she's on it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,You saw the ship sail away?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,There's someone following you?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,bronn,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Hello.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Not you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,My lady. My lady.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,olenna tyrell,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,musician,"A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Very good. Very good. Off you go.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You're an example to us all.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,"Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,As does yours.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,"Yes, very much."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,They certainly are.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,loras,And neither will you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,Your Grace. My king. My queen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did you just bow?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Yes, yes."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"As you say, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you love him.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,brienne,Your Grace.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,She'll do no such thing.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,maid,Your Grace.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,I never meant to annoy anyone.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,pycelle,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,You're in rather a good mood.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,I suppose I am.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,I won't ask why.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Small pleasures.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ellaria,My lord. My lady.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Charmed.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,ellaria,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,No? How tolerant of you.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tywin lannister,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,oberyn martell,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,I'm the rightful king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,King in the North!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Yes!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,Traitor. You're a traitor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,For the Seven Kingdoms!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Let the war begin.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,"Renly, you're no king."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,"Ooh, careful."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,Go on.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,renly dwarf,I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the rightful king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,"Challenge me, ruffian."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,Take that.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,balon dwarf,I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the King in the North!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,stannis dwarf,Not wildfire!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Charge!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,"Ready, again."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,robb dwarf,I am the King in the North! - Charge!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Charge! Yes!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Your head!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey dwarf,Fine gentlemen.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,It did not spill.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,margaery tyrell,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,Your Grace does me a great honor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,It's not meant as an honor.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Bring me my goblet.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,Kneel. Kneel before your king.

2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."

2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"Mm, good. Needs washing down."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,tyrion lannister,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,joffrey lannister,"No. No, you'll wait here... un..."

2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Move away!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,jaime lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,cersei lannister,Help him! Someone help him!

2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,man,He's gone. Our king is gone.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,braavosi man,"In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,He's just a statue.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,man,Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,I'm not afraid.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Hello. Valar Morghulis.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,old man,No one here by that name.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,old man,You have everywhere else to go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,arya stark,But wait!

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,Must be good food if it's crowded.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,waitress,Ale? Ale?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,You are becoming an observant young lady.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,So it was good news.?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,waitress,Ale?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I'll have some.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,My lady!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,What is it?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,Sansa Stark. Don't look!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,You sure?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Littlefinger?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,A bunch of knights with him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Ready the horses.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,We only have one horse.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Find more.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Do you like the taste?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,It gives some men courage.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,Does it give you courage?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,guard,That's far enough.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I was.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,It was after Renly's murder.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I tried to save him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,But you were accused.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,By men who didn't see what happened.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Then what did happen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,No.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sansa stark,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,knight,He asked you to stay.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,guard,After her!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Podrick!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Stop, stop, stop! That's a good boy."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,knight,I guess that means you're unarmed.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Down, Podrick, down!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Podrick?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Yes, my lady?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,You can stand now.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,If they don't want your protection--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,podrick,"No, my lady."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brienne,Get your horse.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,A summons from the queen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,There are only two like it in the world
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,It's a threat.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No note.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Softer.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,What?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Not so loud.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,The world can't know knows she's our daughter.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'll make things better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You never made anything better.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I'm not going to ask him anything.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You go there with an army, it's an act of war."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I never said I was going alone.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys stokeworth,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,Don't they?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Don't who?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,You won't.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Pardon?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Oh.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,"She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,She is.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,lollys,Who's that?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Jaime fucking Lannister.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,On with what?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,It's very good for you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,I would have advised against that.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,How is this good for me?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,bronn,Return from where?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jaime lannister,As far south as south goes.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,trystane,My future queen.

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,"Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,Your brother--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,What will you do about his death.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,You would have me go to war?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,You would have me go to war?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,The whole country would have you go to war.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,doran,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,ellaria,And how long will that be?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey worm,No one here. We go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,In a hurry? You're afraid?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,grey worm,Unsullied fear nothing.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,Fear is useful that way.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,It would send a message.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,How do you know that?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daario,Because I questioned him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,He is born free.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,And how do you know this?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,Everyone knows this.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hizdahr,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mossador,"I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Thank you all for your counsel.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,About what?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,About your father. About the Mad King.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I'm not my father.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,daenerys targaryen,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,barristan,Your Grace.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,There's a bug.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You don't like it?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I want to take a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,The road to Meereen.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,I told you. A ruler.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Still, a man of talent."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Managed to kill a lot of people.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,I find us repulsive.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,varys,No.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,tyrion lannister,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Not him.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,hunters,"Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Take the head.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,Very good.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,qyburn,Over there will be fine.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,meryn,You heard the man. Over there.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,You're the Hand of the King?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace tyrell,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"Oh, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,mace,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,pycelle,I must say I cannot see--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,The king is very busy at this moment.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,What mission?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,That is not your concern as Master of War.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,cersei lannister,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,kevan,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"Right, very good!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"I know ""S""."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,How old were you when you learned to read?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Three.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Did you ever see them?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,gilly,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,What did he do to them in the woods?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Mother.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,Leave us.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,Your Grace.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,You need to stay away from that girl.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Why?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,She's a wildling.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,shireen,Gilly wouldn't do that.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,selyse,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Who then? You?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,No. Only one of their own.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,The Lord Commander's niece.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,That amuses you?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,davos,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,Most likely.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,davos,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"Unpleasant, I expect."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,stannis baratheon,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,jon snow,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."

2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,alliser,"I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,aemon,It is time.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,brother,"It appears to be a tie, Maester."

When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."

2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could remember it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Not so many lions.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I never properly thanked you for that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I did.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,Which you turned to your advantage.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who gave the order to kill me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,King Robert.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who hired the assassins?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,To keep yourself alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"I swear it, my queen."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,"Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,I am called Melisandre.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"No, it didn't."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,What does your Lord expect from me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"No, but I like it better."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,You know him?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,varys,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,He sounds like quite a man.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,melisandre,"Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Read the last bit.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"No, too dangerous."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,But?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,davos,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Lord Tarley.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,dickon,"Ser, Jaime."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"Rickon, isn't it?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,dickon,Dickon.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,That's it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,randyll,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jaime lannister,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,How long?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,But how long 'till...
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Does this look like a baby to you?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"Come, Samwell."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Mormont?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,cersei lannister,They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,qyburn,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,You are.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyrion lannister,The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,Do I have your support?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,You have mine.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellia,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,daenerys targaryen,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,olenna tyrell,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Enter.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,I will see you when I return.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,But you don't know when that will be.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,No one knows.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I wish you good fortune.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Missandei --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,Why?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,You know why.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I don't.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,You are my weakness.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,That's what I am? Your weakness?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I believe it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I do too.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,grey worm,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,missandei,I want to see you. Please.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,And this one.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I wanted to ask you --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,"We're not poets, Tarley."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,This is your moment. Use it wisely.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Oh, you are?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Oh.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,marwyn,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Hello.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What are you doing?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Drink this.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,What is it?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,If you could take off your shirt.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jorah mormont,Have you ever done this before?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,"If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,As long as we get back there before they start.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,man,One more round. It's a long ride.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Ary!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Mmm. This is good.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,I didn't do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,You've been making pies?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,One or two.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Big lady?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,She found me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,What happened to you Ary?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,You got any ale?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Where are you heading?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,King's Landing.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Why?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,I heard Cersei's queen now.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Hmm.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I can't believe someone could do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Cersei would do that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,No. The Boltons are dead.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,What?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,You're lying.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks for the pie.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Thanks.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,hot pie,"No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Come in.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,wolkan,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I know that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yohn royce,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,robett glover,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,lyanna mormont,"Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I'm leaving both in good hands.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sansa stark,Whose?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,You don't belong down here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,I have nothing to say to you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,jon snow,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Nymeria?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,Come with me.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,arya stark,That's not you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,You can't have them all. It's not fair.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,I'm oldest.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,nymeria,The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,obara,"Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,tyene,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,A few times. Never stayed long.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,A boy in every port?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Could we get some more?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,I thought it wasn't for you.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,I'm developing a taste for it.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He's not your servant.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon greyjoy,It's fine.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Once I kill my uncle.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"And what will you be, handsome?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,theon greyjoy,Whatever my queen demands.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,"Oh, I see. Your protector."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,So if someone gets too close to you --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,He might have to intervene.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,hold that person back.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Until they've made their intentions known.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Stay here.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Euron.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,yara greyjoy,Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,ellaria,Kill us! Get it over with!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,Give your uncle a kiss.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,Theon!
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,euron greyjoy,"Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her."

2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister pledged to send her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She did.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I know my brother-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Like you knew your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,The things we do for love.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,This is about survival.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"You don't know me well, Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You vouch for him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I do.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You would fight beside him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I would.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We need every man we can get.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was a fool.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Not for the first time.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Don't you have something better to do?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You make my weapon yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,It's strong enough.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"No, but-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,But you're a fighter.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I've done my share.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You've fought them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I did. Some of them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,How many?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,A few. That was enough.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are they like?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Bad. Really bad.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Really bad""?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I know Death.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,He's got many faces.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I look forward to seeing this one.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,My weapon?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I'll get right on it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm not that person anymore.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No. I'm something else now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're not angry at me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,I'm not angry at anyone.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Why didn't you tell them?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What about afterwards?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,How do you know there is an afterwards?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Well, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, here we are."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Together again.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And the masses rejoice.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,How do they feel about their new queen?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She's your new queen too.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,And she is? Different?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,She is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You're sure about her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I am.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She didn't seem sure about you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Hmm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Was she lying about the baby too?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"No, that part is real."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,What?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,both,A girl's mouth around-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Your cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,My cock.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Ser Jaime.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Lady Brienne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,He's come a long way.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It is.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Yes, I think you're right."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,What are you doing?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I think you know.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I truly don't.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You want me to insult you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,No!
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I better get back.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Have you done something to offend me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,Many things.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Long ago and long forgiven.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You made the right choice.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,But the mind behind all those words-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,royce,"The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You never should have either.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I thought he knew his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Families are complicated.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ours certainly have been.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,A sad thing to have in common.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"He loves you, you know that."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That bothers you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"All my life, I've known one goal"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,Who was the first?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Someone taller.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,I take the Iron Throne.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,wolkan,"Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,My queen.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Your sister?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,But why aren't you with her?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,"Milord, we're not soldiers."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,man,Thank you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,"When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,woman,Thank you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,Which way should I go?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,Which way do you want to go?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,All the children will be going below when the time comes.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gilly,"That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,I'm sure a lot of people would.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,teela,"All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,My little crow.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I thought we'd lost you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Almost.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How did you find each other?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,We met up at the Last Hearth.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,The dead got there first.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Umbers?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,Fighting for the Night King now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,How long do we have?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,The big woman still here?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,They're coming.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,But there are too many of them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Far too many.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Our enemy doesn't tire.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"So, what can we do?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"Yes, he will."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Why? What does he want?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,"An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How will he find you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,His mark is on me.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,He always knows where I am.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sansa stark,You want us to use you as bait?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're not leaving you alone out there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,theon greyjoy,He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Dragonfire will stop him?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,I don't know. No one's ever tried.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,We're all going to die.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,But at least we die together.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Let's get some rest.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Your Grace.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Do you need help?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,No.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You've had a strange journey.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,Stranger than most.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I'd like to hear about it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,bran stark,It's a long story.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,Hello.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,"When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,Then I will take you there.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,missandei,My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,grey worm,My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Have you told her yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,No.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,And now our watch begins.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Gilly? Little Sam?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,They'll be safe down in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,If you want to join them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,To protect them.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,Thenn.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,"Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Now it's just us three.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,edd,"Last man left, burn the rest of us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I wish Father were here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,That would be something to see.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Mm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I was speaking in relative terms.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you miss it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Of course I miss it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,The perils of self-betterment.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Oh! My lady.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,"Thank you, milord."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I don't think that's wise.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,The battle might start at any moment.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Half cup.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,And you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,All right. Just a bit.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"Well, what do we have here?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Ser Davos, join us."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"It could be our last night in this world, you know."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Would you like a drink?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Brought my own.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"They call you ""King Killer."""
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'm sure someone does.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,Maybe I will have that drink.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Guess I've changed.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What are you doing up here?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,What's it look like?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"I fought for you, didn't I?"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,Was he on your list?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,For a little while.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,That's all right.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,beric,The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,"Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sandor,Where are you going?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,That for me?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,This'll work.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,What did the Red Woman want with you?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Why your blood?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Was that your first time?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Your first time with a woman.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,Or after?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,You don't remember?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Yes, I was."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,One? Two? Twenty?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Well, I didn't keep count."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,"Yes, you did."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,Three.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,gendry baratheon,"Arya, I-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,arya stark,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,At least we'll die with honor.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I think we might live.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,All without a shred of combat ability.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Women can't be knights.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Why not?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,Tradition.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Fuck tradition.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,brienne,I don't even want to be a knight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,"I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,I'll prove it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,We have all we need to win this war.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,I don't need you to remind me of that.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyann,It's all right. We're done here.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,lyanna,"I wish you good fortune, cousin."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,"Thank you, my lady."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,What have you got there?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,You still have a family.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jorah mormont,I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I'll see you when it's through.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I hope we win.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jaime lannister,We'd better get some rest.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,"No, let's stay a bit longer."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,We're out of wine.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,davos,You'll pray for a quick death.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tormund,Mm-mm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,tyrion lannister,Mmm.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,"High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,The ones who'd been gone for so very long.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who's that?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,He didn't. He loved her.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,That's impossible.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,I wish it were.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,Who told you this?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,Bran. He saw it.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,He saw it?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,jon snow,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,daenerys targaryen,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
