2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"You can always say no, Ned."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maester luwin,I'm told he drinks all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"In any case, candles."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I promise.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,D'you know what?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,What?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Move!

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Where's the Imp?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Will you shut up?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Arya.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Would you please shut up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ned.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,We both did.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I'm not worthy of the honor.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I did hear something about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,And the other brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,The queen has two brothers?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,I hear they call him the Imp.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Clever girl.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Have you?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Don't get up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,M'lord.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Close the door!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,She belonged with me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Not all of them.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maid,"It's too hot, my lady."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where is he?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Come forward, my dear."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where's he going?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The ceremony is over.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When will they be married?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Is it true they lie with their horses?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Do you take me for a fool?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't know.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,He's so handsome.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Sansa…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Is he dead yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Uncle Benjen!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,So take me with you when you go back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Jon…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I'm ready to swear your oath.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I don't care about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What're you doing back there?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The two he was with are still missing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,A wildling ambush.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Uncle Benjen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Robb boy. How are ye?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I'm good.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"I think so, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And have you bled yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"No, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I hear the same.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Your pardon.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I don't fight in tournaments.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,No? Getting a little old for it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Well said.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Time for bed.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I won't let him take you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,How did he get so fat?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,a voice,"It's Maester Luwin, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Send him in.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Stay.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,What news?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,A different time. Different king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,When their omens favor war.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Make him happy.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,khal drogo,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Do you know the Common Tongue?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,"Rough night, Imp?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"No, but I'm still better than you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I hope I'll serve you well.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Stop. STOP.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Are you completely mad?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,It's all right. It's all right.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I already said it was well struck.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Who's next?

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Are you drunk?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,ser dontos,"No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,ser dontos,"Are you sure, Your Grace?"

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What did you say? Did you say I can't?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sandor clegane,"The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,ser dontos,"Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bronn,Can't imagine why.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,We heard you were dead.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,myrcella,I'm glad you're not dead.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sansa stark,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Of course you are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,What work? . Why are you here?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,pycelle,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,pycelle,A common superstition.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"I do, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And are you not a Lord at my command?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,janos,"Yes, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our father is Hand of the King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I tried to stop it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What do you know about warfare?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,You are here to advise him.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,How?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,One.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,One?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,Of course I remember!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,I - I believe it will.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,portan,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,Don't have any pain.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Lucky for you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,That way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,You've been having those dreams again.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't dream.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Everyone dreams.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,He said they ate meat.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,I remember.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,Does it ever end?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,And you're sure there's no other way?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,No one will take my dragons.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,As you are mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,You never have.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,This is… bad time to start.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,Having a rough time of it?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Nothing's killed me yet.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Are those girls?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,Craster's daughters.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,It's beyond foul.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,What happens to the boys?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Hmm?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,We're not Southerners.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,The lad meant no harm.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,You bring any of that good wine with you?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,Give it here.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,And where does he plan marching this army?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jaime lannister,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Curious.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Yes.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And which truth is that?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Knowledge is power.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You're Ser Alton Lannister?

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Of course they are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Men who fought my father.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You can't go to Winterfell.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I beg your pardon?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,Why in the name of all the Gods -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I will ride at first light.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Give Lord Renly my regards.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What is all this?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,His life is in danger.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. . That will be all, Mother."

2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sam,Brother?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,Did you send the ravens?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jeor,"That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,main,CREDITS
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,Crow!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,boy,Crow!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,girl,Look over there!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,girl,Crow! Look over here! Look!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,woman,"Ah, look, crow coming!"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,You're wearing the wrong color.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Mance was a ranger.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Sure, you will."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,boy,Oh!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,What happened to their fathers?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,I smell a crow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rattleshirt,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,What do we want with a baby crow?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ygritte,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,"Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tormund,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,He wants me to lead one day.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I want to be free.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,You saw what?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jon snow,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,mance,We'll need to find you a new cloak.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,What if you took off that bit there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,I want you to take it off.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,whore,Mouth.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I didn't hear that.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,"Apologies, ser."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Lord Tyrion sent me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"I will murder you, boy."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,He said it was a matter of life and death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Pod?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,It's your sister. The queen.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,What are they doing here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think so."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,They stay outside.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you here?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're meeting Father today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How do you know that?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You're going to make me cry.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why do you care what I want from him?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Slandered? When?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"I was nine, too."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It's not slander if it's true.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Any lies in particular?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Still makes me more clever than you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,Ser Meryn Trant.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,You're no knight.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Pod.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,podrick,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,meryn trant,"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I've been doing that for a while now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Do you grow bored protecting me?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I grow poor protecting you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Briefly.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I thought we were friends.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,How much?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Double?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,bronn,Which means you can afford it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Here. Here! Help me!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,Who are you?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,man,"Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,He may have swam ashore as you did.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Will you take me there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,This war is not over.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,We're both sworn to King Stannis.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,What?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,I'm a pirate.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You're a smuggler.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Take me back there, please."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,You cannot turn Stannis against her.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,salladhor,"When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard karstark,Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,"The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,rickard karstark,Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,roose bolton,The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,A Mallister?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,catelyn stark,Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,She's your mother.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Water. Water.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,This needs to be cleaned and closed.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,robb stark,"What's your name, friend?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Qyburn.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,talisa,You're lucky to be alive.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,qyburn,Lucky?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Am I enjoying it?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,blows on his paper to dry the ink.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,You want Casterly Rock?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,It is mine by right.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tyrion lannister,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,tywin lannister,"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Why Dorne?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Don't ruin the game.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"I told you, I don't want to play."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,What about that one there?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,That one? It's going to Volantis.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Lord Baelish.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,I won't tell anyone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,How do I know?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sansa stark,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,You're her handmaiden?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Yes. And you're his...?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,I help manage his affairs.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,He's an important person.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,"So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,Yes.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,Given where we started.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,And where is that?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,shae,I always do.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,ros,Watch out for her with him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,They're growing fast.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I heard you were dead.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Not yet.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,We are alone.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,I am fighting.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,By burning prisoners alive?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,I'm not your enemy.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,You are my enemy.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,Death by fire is the purest death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,stannis baratheon,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,Your Grace!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Come on.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,"You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,davos,She will destroy us all!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,melisandre,I will pray for you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Guard
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,Guard #2
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,Why have we stopped?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,"It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,maid,"My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Why?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Pardon me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,maid,"Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,I have others.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,guard,"Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,No.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And your mother?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,She died when she had me.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,child,He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Your Grace.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"That's a lovely gown, my lady."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Yes.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,loras,Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,margaery tyrell,"Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,joffrey lannister,"Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,cersei lannister,I'm sure she does.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,They will stand until they drop.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Such is their obedience.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Even the bravest men fear death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,The knight says even brave men fear death.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell the old man he smells of piss.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"Truly, master?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,"No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Tell the good master there is no need.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,"Here, I'm done with you."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,unsullied,This one is pleased to have served you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,What a soft mewling fool this one is.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,"My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,How many do you have to sell?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Eight thousand.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,kraznys mo nakloz,Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,missandei,Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,Eight thousand dead babies.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own them, these men..."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,They're not men. Not anymore.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,The warlocks.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,"I owe you my life, Ser."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,barristan,"The honor is mine, my queen."
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,daenerys targaryen,You know this man?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,jorah mormont,I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,barristan,"King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Magnificent.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Looks fresh-forged.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,It is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,From someone who no longer had need of it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,And now we have two.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Two?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll have to train your left hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll never be as good.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Home?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,No?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,I don't believe I asked you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's my answer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,What do you want?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Supper would be nice.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I suppose you want the sword back.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,Keep it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tywin lannister,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Please don't.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Oh.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Ah, here we are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Can you read the sigils?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Yellow balls?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,I need a sigil.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,podrick,"I don't see it, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,Will he?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,And where is Prince Oberyn?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,dornish lord,"Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,You must be weary after such a long journey.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Look at this one. How lovely is she?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Beautiful. But pale.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You like?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Timid. Timid bores me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"You're not timid, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Not timid.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you like women?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,whore,"When they look like her, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,This one will do nicely.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"Very good, my lady."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Oh, I'm not a lady."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,A term of courtesy in this establishment.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Any of the others?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,The two girls can leave.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You stay.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,My lord.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Take off your clothes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,Which way do you like it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,My way .
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,Oberyn.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,Weep o'er his hall...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Oberyn, don't."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgans friend,"You lost, friend?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgans friend,I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,We don't like the smell.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ellaria,"Come with me, lover."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,"Gods, look at this one."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olyvar,"Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,morgan,Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,trouble.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Apologies, my love."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,What are you? His hired killer?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,How did that come to pass?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,bronn,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Oh, they take all kinds."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Even Dornishmen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I was invited to the royal wedding.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I thought we were speaking truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't actually present.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,I'm asking you a question.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I've heard rumors.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,oberyn martell,"If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Ser Barristan.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,"Gambling, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Gambling?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,crowd,Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,How long have they been at it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"Since midnight, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,grey worm,"You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,I'd rather have no brains and two balls.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You need to eat something.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Pigeon pie.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"No, thank you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Lemon cakes?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You love lemon cakes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Tell her she needs to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, you do need to eat."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't need to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,She needs to eat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I can't let you starve.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I swore to protect you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,How can you help me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"I don't know, but I can try."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,My lion.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I haven't forgotten.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,I want you. Don't you want me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Things are a bit tense right now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What things?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You need to relax.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Don't you want to relax?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,What's wrong?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,I told you. It's not a good time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shae.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Do you love her?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,That's not an answer.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Of course I don't love her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You tried to ship me away.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Ship you away?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,What in the world are you talking about?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,"If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tyrion lannister,Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,shae,You want me to stay?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,"A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Days?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Uh... a hook would be more practical.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Elegant, I think."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Thank you for your help with the other matter.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,The symptoms have abated?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,qyburn,"Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Odd little man.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What symptoms?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Symptoms that are not your concern.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You let him touch you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You jealous?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You drink more than you used to.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Yes.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,It must have been traumatic for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,A rather short siege.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Father disowned me today.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You're forgetting Tyrion.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Not now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Something's changed.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to apologize for?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,For leaving me.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,You took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,I... What are you saying?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,I'm saying you took too long.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,cersei lannister,Come in.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Go away.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,marei,"Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,We wait for Mance's orders.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,"Yeah, well, he's a liar."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I did.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Mance sent you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,How did you find us?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,"You came from the south, not the north."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,warg,Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,Help yourself.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,tormund,I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,She yours?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ygritte,I'm not anybody's.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,styr,"I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,officer,Draw. Loose.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,Sometimes I want to hate you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,They're... they're ready for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I've done plenty wrong.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I didn't murder him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,He wanted me to kill him.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,I do.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,The law is the law. The boy must die.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,Giants?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slunt,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,janos slynt,How dare you?!
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jon snow,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,"I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,"Yes, you are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,And I don't trust the bastard.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,He told the truth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,alliser thorne,And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,maester aemon,I grew up in King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,Nonsense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,My word.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,olenna tyrell,You dare not refuse.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,A shadow?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,Joffrey is our king now.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,I meant no offense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,margaery tyrell,And you've given none.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,"Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,meryn,"I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,meryn,The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,"I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Busy getting captured.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,So they say.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Ser Jaime Lannister.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,There's still time.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,joffrey lannister,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever been to Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,missandei,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,A dusk rose.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,And this one's called lady's lace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk without shoes?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daario,Your Grace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jorah mormont,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,barristan,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,daenerys targaryen,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,There she is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Yes, there she is."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,And? You made a promise.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,To keep them safe.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,A complication does not release you from a vow.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,brienne,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,jaime lannister,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,You're drunk.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,Anyone would have done the same.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,"It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sansa stark,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,ser dontos,Yeah.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,The little lady wants a pony.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,The little lady wants away from your stench.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,No.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're not very smart, are you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'm not a thief.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,A man's got to have a code.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,I'm hungry. You're hungry.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He killed Lommy.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,What the fuck's a Lommy?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Got what?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,My sword Needle.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Needle? Of course you named your sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Lots of people name their swords.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Lots of cunts.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,What are you... get back here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,My brother gave me that sword.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Get back here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,He killed my friend.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,"Come on, give it up."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Come here.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Let's have a feel there.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,man,Leave it.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,innkeeper,"Please, she's a good girl."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,I know you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You're the Hound.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Just keeping the king's peace.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,No need. The war's over.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,None taken.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,She's all right. I've had better.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'm not going to King's Landing.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Fuck the king.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You got money to pay for it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,You paid for it?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,"No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Not a penny.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,I'll still take that chicken.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You don't seem to understand the situation.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sandor clegane,Someone is.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,What? What do you mean?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,polliver,Carry me?
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Fine little blade.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,arya stark,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,We shouldn't be out here alone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Why not?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,If your father hears…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,He'll never know we've been gone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,But if he finds out…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,Are you sure?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Yes.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,We shouldn't go in.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Of course we should.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Get out. Get out!
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,Let's go…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Listen to your friend.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,You don't know what I am.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Your blood. Give me a taste.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Three questions you get. You won't like the answers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,But I will be queen?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Will the king and I have children?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,That doesn't make sense.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,maggy,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melara,"Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,"But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,priest,From all seven kingdoms…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They will wait.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,They?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jaime lannister,This is exactly what they want.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Apologies.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Pentos?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Much better.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,My lord?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,In a box. Why stop now?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,The future is shit. Just like the past.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,prostitute,You want the same? Same as always?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,white rat,You… you don't have to.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,prostitute,Habit.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Sons of the Harpy?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,They've never killed before.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,"White Rat, your grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,barristan,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mossador,Make them very angry.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,Torgo Nudho.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,Missandei hin Naath.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,I wanted to speak with you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,Why do you come?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,missandei,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grey worm,I do not know. I must go.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Get your shield up.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olly,It's too heavy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,"Shouldn't you be training, too?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,alliser,Not soldiers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,That one hates me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,All the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,Don't let them send us away.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,Sam! Don't let them send us away.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,gilly,"You can't leave, they'll execute you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,The king wants a word.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You're not cold, my lady?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Feel.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Are you a virgin?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,No.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Roose Bolton.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They're good men.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,It's where she belonged.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,davos,It's a fair offer. More than fair.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I don't think that's likely.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"You admire him, don't you?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I respect him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Your grace…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,or he burns.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,How much time do I have?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master of arms,"Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,yohn royce,My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,squire,My lord.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,master of arms,"Sword up, my lord!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,He has other gifts.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,Does he?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,royce,"He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,But I'm you're squire.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Do you even know what a squire is?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,An attendant to a knight?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,"Well, where would I go?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,"I don't care, I'm not your mother."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,You swore to find the Stark girls.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,podrick,Sansa still might.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,brienne,Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,I did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,But we're heading west.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,We are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sansa stark,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Thank you so much for your kind words.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,grand maester pyrcelle,"Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel lannister,Your grace.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,My deepest sympathies.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan lannister,I apologize for my son's appearance.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,"Uncle, it's quite alright."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,kevan,Of course.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What can I do for you?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,You can forgive me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,I led you into the darkness.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,I don't know what you're talking about.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,lancel,"I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,cersei lannister,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,It looks like Dorne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,No it doesn't.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Sandstone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Fine.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,It's Dorne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,We're late for dinner as it is.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,You're very respectful.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,I'm very hungry.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,What's your name?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,olyvar,"Olyvar, my lady."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,"I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Lucky you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Unlucky you.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,"If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,loras,Perhaps?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,margaery tyrell,Perhaps?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Imp, half-man."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Not for a coward.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You never told me why you set me free.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Your brother asked me to.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You could have said no.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I'm not well-suited for work.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,I never said you were perfect.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,What is it you want exactly?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Good luck finding him.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,varys,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,tyrion lannister,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario naharis,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr zo loraq,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Good.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,They did ask for some concessions.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Concessions?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,"In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,No fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,hizdahr,If you--
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,How many times must I say no before you understand?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,You should reopen the fighting pits.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,What?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,"You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daario,A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Viserion? Rhaegal?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,daenerys targaryen,Easy. Easy. Easy.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,So here we are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Here we are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"No, but it will be."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You know what Stannis wants?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Shouldn't a king be bold?
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,Then bend the knee and save your people.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,They'll burn you alive.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,"You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,jon snow,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,stannis baratheon,Kneel and live.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,mance,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,melisandre,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."

2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,ramsay bolton,"Myranda wasn't, though What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't? She was fearless There was nothing she wouldn't do."
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,ramsay bolton,Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,maester wolkan,"Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,ramsay bolton,"Buried, burned?"

2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,roose,"I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,roose,A reckoning will come We need the North to face it The entire North They won't back us without Sansa Stark We no longer have Sansa Stark You played your games with her You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone

2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,jaime lannister,"Shh, shh Don't think about it"
2015-04-24,Season 6,Episode 1,The Red Woman,cersei lannister,I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone

2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're good at this, you know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,At what?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,At ruling.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Why are you laughing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,He never said that to me.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I'm not trying to undermine you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,Would that be so terrible?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,wolkan,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,What does she want?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jon snow,You almost sound as if you admire her.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I learned a great deal from her.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,What is this?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"No, not angry."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Are you afraid of me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Should I be?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Dragonstone.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the east.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"A dynasty for us, then."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,We never talked about Tommen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,There's nothing to say.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Our baby boy killed himself.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Cersei--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Not all of them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Well, it looks like all of them."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,A queen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jaime lannister,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,If not the most humble.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,What do you want in return?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,I decline your proposal.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,Why?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,cersei lannister,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,euron greyjoy,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Weigh that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,What's the weight?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Um, 147."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,I don't remember your proposition.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Sources in the restricted area?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"So, you believe me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,marwyn,Be a good lad. Clean this up.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,Nope.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,tormund,You're a lucky man.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,petyr,My lady.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,Why is he still here?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,brienne,He wants something.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sansa stark,I know exactly what he wants.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,It's a new one.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,I don't want to steal your food.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,You heading south?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,King's Landing.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Poor girl.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"Not so bad, is it?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Worst place in the world.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,What are you doing in the Riverlands?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Here you go. Guests first.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,My wife's just had our first baby.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,Boy or girl?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,I hope it's a girl.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,Why?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,Are you old enough to drink?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,It's really good.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,man,"So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,arya stark,I'm going to kill the queen.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Bad night to be outdoors.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Why are you always in such a foul mood?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Experience.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,This seems like a good place to spend the night.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,These people don't want us here.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I don't like the look of it.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,They don't.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,How do you think it ended for them?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,With death.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Doesn't matter now.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"No, doesn't matter now."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,But there's nothing special about you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,You're right about that.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,And?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Your Lord.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Clegane.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,What do you want?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Look into the flames.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I don't want to look in the damn flames.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,What do you see?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Logs burning.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,Keep looking. What do you see?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,What else?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Thousands of them.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,beric,"Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,"What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Burying the dead.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,thoros,You knew these people.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,Not really.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sandor,"We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,little sam,Mom.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,"You should really sleep, Sam."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,The dead don't.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,Legends of the Long Night.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,What is it?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,gilly,That's dragonglass?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah mormont,Has she come yet?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Who?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,jorah mormont,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam,Haven't heard anything.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,daenerys targaryen,Shall we begin?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Look at you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You're a man.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,Almost.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where's Arya?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Lurking somewhere.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,And my lord.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,umber,And my queen. Sorry.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,maester wolkan,"At once, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna mormont,Your Grace.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,A lord? Nothing at all?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's not important.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,lyanna,Not important? We named you King in the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,King of the North!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever they want.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Sorry 'bout that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Are these the last of the wagons?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Aye.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"All right, let's get it all to the forges."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,My lord. My lady.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,royce,My lady.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,It had its moments.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Apologies for leaving like that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,We both survived.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She did.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,And you believed her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You used to be taller.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,How did you sneak up on me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You still have it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Needle.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Have you ever used it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Once or twice.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Valyrian steel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Jealous?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Too heavy for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Now you're defending her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't forget that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,Good.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Are we in King's Landing?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Mm.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You picked the losing side.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,Horses?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,Two thousand.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,And elephants?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,harry,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Am I most welcome here?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I was hoping we could talk in private.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,After the war. That was our agreement.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Wars sometimes last years.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,How?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,They were lesser men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,"Archie, was it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,And William.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,Tall handsome William?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,Did you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Nearly killed it.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,marei,That's brave.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,That boy Eddie.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,The ginger?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dirah,How does he sleep with no eyelids?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,You're kidding me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,crayah,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,Which girl?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bronn,That fucking family.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,qyburn,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,I wanted those elephants.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You're insulting my late husband?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Are you offended?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,And the Kingslayer?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Life is boring.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You're not boring, I'll give you that."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,Do I please the queen?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,cersei lannister,But now I want to be alone.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,euron greyjoy,I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,We can take our home back.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Daenerys went north.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You're my queen. I go where you command.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,yara greyjoy,But kill the bastards anyway.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,wolkan,"Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,The Karstarks.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,Can't argue with that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And our queen is grateful.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,davos,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,They do make a handsome couple.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm not that old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Not as old as him.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What is that?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,varys,Nothing lasts.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,How many today?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,dothraki man,Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's the matter?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong with them?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They don't like the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What if he doesn't want me to?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What do I hold onto?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you can.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,No one would find us.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,We'd be pretty old.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So keep your queen warm.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Don't be afraid.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,Gendry?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,man,He's here.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"You're saying you're good, is that it?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Leave him be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,I heard you were here. You left me to die.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,First I robbed you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sandor,"You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, thanks. So have you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"I mean, you look good."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Thanks. So do you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,"Stay close to that forge, then."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Is that a command, Lady Stark?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Don't call me that.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"As you wish, milady."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Here's my wish.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What do you need something like this for?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,Can you make it or not?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,You already have a sword. What's that?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,gendry baratheon,It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,arya stark,You don't know any other rich girls.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Come in.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,The King in the North.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I told you we needed allies.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,And a Targaryen queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Do you have any faith in me at all?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,You know I do.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,"No, she's much prettier."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sansa stark,Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Oh!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,So you're the man?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jorah mormont,"They could, they just wouldn't."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there must be something I could give you."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,For what crime?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,And also a sword.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,From the Citadel?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Not Randyll Tarly?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You know him?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Your brother stood with your father.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Of course.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,What are you doing out here?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,"Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,bran stark,I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Were you hiding from me?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Of course not.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She's good.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Little Sam?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Don't you know?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Know what?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She didn't tell you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Would you have done it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I wasn't a king.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,But you were. You've always been.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,What are you talking about?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,Daenerys is our queen.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She shouldn't be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,jon snow,That's treason.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,"Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,I've always had blue eyes!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,beric,Did you find anyone?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,The Umber boy.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,beric,It's a message. From the Night King.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,edd,We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,"If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,tormund,We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
