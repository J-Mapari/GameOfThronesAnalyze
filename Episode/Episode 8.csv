2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,"If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,king joffrey,Your sweet words have moved me.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,He will.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Riders approaching!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,mar,Open the gate!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Envy isn't attractive.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,What envy?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Exactly.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,They made me a promise
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Don't call me
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You are weak. And you're stupid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,I'm warning you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Go on, then. Warn me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Leave us.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,I don't intend to die.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,I already got one crow. Don't need two.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,And now he wishes he did. Gut him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,Mance will want him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,"He runs, I'll chop his balls off."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ygritte,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,I know.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,The others?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They died because of me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,qhorin,See that it wasn't for nothing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,wildling,"All right, up, lad."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,wildling,"Come on, on your feet, now. Move it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Is she beautiful?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I've never met her.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,What's her name?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,An important bridge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Ah.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I wish I could have met him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He would have liked you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,Then why don't you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That would be a start.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rider,"Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How? How?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Tell me this isn't true.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,For the girls.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,You betrayed me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rickard karstark,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rickard karstark,I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,"Forty, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,catelyn stark,Robb.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Damn.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,Brienne of Tarth.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,You will not provoke me to anger.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,I've never seen you fight.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaime lannister,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,brienne,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,Surrender the Iron Throne?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,Too close to Casterly Rock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,kevan,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tywin lannister,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,guard,You've got some questions to answer.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Who killed Ser Amory?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,I don't know! Please!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,"I told you, I don't know. Please."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rorge,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Where's Jaqen?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,rorge,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,guard,"Come on, time to kill some wolves."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,"You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,How would I know?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,You need him?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,He's helping me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,I saw him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Where?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,Ow!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,On patrol. Let go of my ears.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,What do you want with him anyway?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,They'll never trust me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,They might. If you do what needs to be done.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jon snow,I didn't.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,quorin,"I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,lord of bones,"He's not yours to kill, crow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Do you have to do that here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I like to keep me hands clean.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,What?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Stannis will be here any day.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,And one of these explains how to beat him?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,For questioning?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We talked about this.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,We could throw books at his men.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,We don't have that many books.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,bronn,"We don't have that many men, either."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,What do we have?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Pig shit.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,You lack imagination.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,Where do you think Jon is right now?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,eddision,So did his father.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,What in seven hells is that?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Look.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,"If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,It's been here a long time.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Dragonglass?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam,The maesters call it obsidian.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,grenn,Why would a brother hide it here?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dolorous edd,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,soldier,Mind where you're going.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'm sorry. I'll-
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Where were you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A man has patrol duty.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,This a man cannot do.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,You promised you'd help me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl gives a man his own name?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,That's right.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Un-name me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,No.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Please?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,I'll un-name you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,Thank you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,If you help me and my friends escape.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,"A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,A girl will obey.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jaqen hghar,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"Thank you, Podrick."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Odd little boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You and Varys both.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's only a boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,He's not ready.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because he doesn't have a cock.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Neither do you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,It's not that little.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Why are you smiling?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I'm happy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And why are you happy?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Because I have your little whore.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I thought you preferred blondes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Why do you care who I fuck?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Where did you find her?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I promise I will free you.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,ros,Don't forget me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Never.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,cersei lannister,Get out.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Shae!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're beautiful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,Then why do you look sad?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We have to be more careful.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,There are people who want to hurt me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I'm yours.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Promise me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,shae,I'm yours and you are mine.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Still no word?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,roose bolton,My lady.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,How are you?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,You have every right. You're a king.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,What kind do you want to be?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"No. No, you would not."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,robb stark,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,talisa,I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Shut up.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,"Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Shut up. What did you bring?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,yara greyjoy,Shut up. What did you bring?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What did he want us to do about those guards?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,What about the guards?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,He didn't say anything about the guards.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,We have to trust him.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,hot pie,I want to go back to the kitchens.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,arya stark,Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,gendry baratheon,"Arry, don't."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,Away! Reset!
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Will it hold?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,man,"Again, pull!"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"I thank you, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Do you? Why?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,My father was a crabber.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,Some are happy to do it to my face.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,He was only a boy.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,I was relieved they did not.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,davos,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,stannis baratheon,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,joffrey lannister,They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,Imagine Stannis' terror.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,I am trying.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"I wish we could, too."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,What do you want? Tell me.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,A most highborn plumber.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,I do. Last thing I expected.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,And you play it well.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,We should sail there immediately.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,varys,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,tyrion lannister,"One game at a time, my friend."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,Astapor?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,We cannot stay here.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,jorah mormont,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,daenerys targaryen,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,We should bury them.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,What's this?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,theon greyjoy,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,dagmer,"His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,You're right so far.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,Must have been the farmer's boys.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,luwin,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,osha,They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"I'll give you one try, girl."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,There's no one worse than you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,You're lying.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,"Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Is that the Blackwater?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,But why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,arya stark,Why would they be at the Twins?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sandor clegane,Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You know these men?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Is he more titan or bastard?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,How many?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Enough to make a difference?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,I imagine you're right.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,He may not agree to meet.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Daario Naharis
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,Mind your tongue.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"You, slave girl, bring wine."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,We have no slaves here.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Under two thousand, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"We have more, don't we?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,Ten thousand Unsullied.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You're very young to be a captain.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,jorah mormont,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Or you could fight for me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,I would pay you as much and more.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,"Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,grey worm,"My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"A barrel, then."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,barristan,"Gladly, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What do you mean to do with him?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You know what I mean to do with him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You've slaughtered many lambs?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,And none have seen the blade.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Your Grace.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,They feeding you enough?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You don't belong in a place like this.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Melisandre's returned.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I didn't know she'd been gone.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,She says there's power in king's blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,She's going to kill him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,Sacrifice him.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,Because he has your blood in his veins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,So did Renly.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,You have little regard for your own life.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,davos,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You talk too much.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I fight for beauty.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,For beauty?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,We fight for gold.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,You'll die young.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,She's well guarded.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,prendahl,Which one of us?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Close your eyes, love."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,mero,"Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You have something for me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Valar morghulis.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"You look very handsome, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,When I have to.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, today you have to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"You look radiant, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Radiant? Why radiant?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,It's the word that came to mind.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Of course. They play it so often here at court.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,margaery tyrell,Gone.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Could you-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Thank you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,septon,"Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Have you ever seen one like it?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Here, taste this."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You think I'm trying to poison you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,That's good.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,That's really good.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Where do you think it's from?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I couldn't even guess.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,There are no mistakes. Not for us.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,What are you doing?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You have to trust me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,What-? Get it away. Get it off me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,Why are you doing this?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,melisandre,You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gendry baratheon,"Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,olenna tyrell,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,I've got a lifetime for that.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Stay.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,You seem rather drunk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,More than once.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,loras,"Well, my father once told me-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,cersei lannister,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Congratulations, my lady."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,Time for the bedding ceremony.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,There will be no bedding ceremony.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,There will be if I command it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,joffrey lannister,What did you say? What did you say?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tywin lannister,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, my lord?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Nothing was ever wiser.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Astoundingly long.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,Fourteen.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,But your father-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sansa stark,What if I never want you to?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,And so my watch begins.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Ninteen
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,"Yes, Your Grace."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Athjahakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Athjahaka.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,Ath-ja-hakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Athjahakar.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,missandei,"Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,No screaming or she dies.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do you want?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Let her go.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"Don't scream, lovely girl."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You were sent here to kill me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,So why haven't you?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I don't want to.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,What do your captains have to say about that?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,You should ask them.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,We had philosophical differences.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Over what?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,You're a strange man.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,And this is supposed to impress me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,Yes.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Will you fight for me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daenerys targaryen,Swear to me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,daario,"The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,tyrion lannister,You really ought to knock.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,shae,I brought your breakfast.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,How hard can it be to build a fire?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,He winked at me before.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I doubt it.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I saw him wink at me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,He blinked.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,A what?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,A wink is on purpose.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I'll build that fire.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Don't you think he should have a name?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,I don't know many boys' names.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Craster.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Mormont.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Why is it a last name?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,"No, Randyll Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Randyll is a handsome name.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Please don't name him Randyll.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Is your father cruel like mine?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Different manner of cruel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"Not Randyll, then."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,Don't. Don't go out there.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,I'll be back. I just want to look.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,It's come for the baby.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,Stay back!
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam,You stay back!
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,"No, you can't have him! No!"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,gilly,No!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,Here we are.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,The Rains of Castamere!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"Well, what are you going to say?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,I'm sorry it woke you up.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Don't you ever touch him.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,Shut your mouth.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,moles town whore,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,gilly,No it's not.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,I should never have left her there.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,You couldn't have known.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,She's dead because of me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pyp,"Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam,She might have.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jon snow,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,A hundred thousand.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grenn,"And there's what, 5 of us left."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,"If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pyp,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ed,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You think he was spying on you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"No, not spying."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,Yes your grace.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,But you are not Dothraki.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,He was interested.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I believe he was interested.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,All of it?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The...the pillar an the stones.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"I don't know, your grace."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Haven't you ever wondered?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"Yes, your grace."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,To me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,To me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,Why? Why sorry?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,"approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,missandei,in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,grey worm,in Valyrian* So am I.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,And what are you really?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,I'm Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Until when?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Always. Forever.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,And why should I believe that?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,everyone,What is dead may never die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,And what does Lord Bolton want?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,He wants us to surrender?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,shame fought with honor.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,scared* You don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,The Ironborn will not surrender.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,whispering* Reek. Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ralf,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Reek.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,man,"If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,theon greyjoy,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,I believe we will. To our new home.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,My lord...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"A niece of yours, I believe."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,We'd like to speak with her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Let me fetch her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,My lady...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,I wasn't asking you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,He can stay.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser vance,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Lady Sansa.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Are you questioning our courage?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lady anya,More often they die young.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord royce,"Aye, it's time."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,boy,Ser Barristan.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Yes? Who sent you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Ser Barristan.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Ser Jorah.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,What's this?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Who gave you this?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,Does it matter?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Have you told her?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Let me speak with her in private.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser barristan,You'll never be alone with her again.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Why did the usurper pardon you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,If we could speak alone.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,It is not forged.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Why, then?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What was the content of these letters?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Information.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,What information?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Yes or no?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Khaleesi.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,Yes.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,Because you knew it was poisoned.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I suspected.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You betrayed me from the first.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,and you want me to forgive you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,I have loved you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ser jorah,"Daenerys, please."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,daenerys targaryen,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,lord bolton,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,No.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Moors, fields, hills."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Tell me what you see.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Nothing.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,roose,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,Ramsay Snow.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,roose,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ramsay bolton,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Yes?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,That's not an answer.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,I don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Neither do I.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,I know what you want.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,Do you?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,Lots of things make me happy.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,Like what?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You should have let me burn it.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,It's a fleabite.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Aye, she'll pay."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,I've never even met her.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,arya stark,I'm not a lady.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sandor clegane,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,guard,Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,You shouldn't be.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,robin,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,petyr,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sansa stark,Shall we go?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Soon.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I've never seen him fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Oberyn believes in himself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Beheading.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Cousins.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,together,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Nothing made him happier.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"The joke wore thin, though."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,For you. You drifted away.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I had other interests.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Why?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,He was twice your size.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,I don't know.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,jaime lannister,Good luck today.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Looks like very light armor.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I like to move around.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Today is not the day I die.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,You're going to fight that?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to kill that.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tyrion lannister,Thank the gods.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,pycell,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,ellaria,Don't leave me alone in this world.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Never.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Have they told you who I am?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,Some dead man.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You raped her! You murdered her!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,You killed her children!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,oberyn martell,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,mountain,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,tywin lannister,"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,If only I were otherwise.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I know.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, many opportunities."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,And did he?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No. Not until forced to do so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So I should kill him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Confess.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My son. Let me speak to--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Confess. I meant it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,My face will be the last thing you see before--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,How will she serve him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,What will she do there?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,She will see.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,See what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Your oysters fresh?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,Best in the city.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,thin man,Can't do it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,man,"Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,arya stark,And then what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,A gift for the Thin Man.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,She is not ready.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,waif,And if she's not?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jaqen hghar,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,The charges?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,All lies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,Tell him I need to speak to him.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can't stay here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,qyburn,Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Why. Why Theon.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't. They were only--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Only what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I can't..
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,Tell me!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"I can't, not unless the master says..."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Tell me, they weren't what?!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't...
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,You didn't…?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,I can't talk to you anymore.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sansa stark,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,theon greyjoy,"Not Theon, Reek!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,bolton bannerman,"Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,"And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,You disagree?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,"Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,And what do you recommend?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,roose,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,ramsay bolton,I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,It's probably my safest option.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,And what would your father do?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Is that why you killed him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I've heard stories.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Which kind is that?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,But you trust him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The brother who killed my father.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,That's the one.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to kill you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,No? Banish me?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,Advise you on what?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,How to get what I want.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,The common people.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tyrion lannister,It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,You struck me.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,master,"You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jorah mormont,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,septa,Thirsty? Confess.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,cersei lannister,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,Does it hurt?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,Good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,How are you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,You know what I mean.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I'm good.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Are you scared?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,A little.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Me too.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Who's there?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Olly.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Come in.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,I heard what happened.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Figured you were hungry.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,You're a good lad.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,gilly,I need to check on baby Sam.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Now then. How can I help?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,It's about the Lord Commander.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Yes?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,We've been fighting them for years.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,"The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Olly...
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,How can he trust him?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,olly,You believe that?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,With all my heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam,Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,You trust me Jon Snow?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Does that make me a fool?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,We are fools together now.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,War.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You don't give the orders here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I'm not giving an order.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,Why aren't you in chains?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He's not my prisoner.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,What is he?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're allies.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I don't fight for the crows.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,lord of bones,"Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,Gather the elders and let's talk.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,You built that wall to keep us out.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,You saw this?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,No. But I trust the man.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,Come with you where?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,If…?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Where is Mance?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,He died.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,How?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,I put an arrow through his heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,This is the way.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wildling elder,I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,giant,Tormund.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,I fucking hate Thenns.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,How many are with us? 5000?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,I'm not good at counting.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,We're leaving too many behind.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,And he knew them better than I ever will.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,daughter,I wanna go with you.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,wun wun,Lokh kif rukh?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Shut the gate.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Shut the gate!!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,shouting,Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Ready your arrows!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get in line! Get in line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Hold the line! Hold the line!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,nights watch brother,Lord Commander!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,brother,But you'll never make it--
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Now!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You should be on one of those boats.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,You have my word. I've given orders.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,karsi,Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,The Dragonglass!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,"You're with me, lad! Now!"
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,loboda,Get the glass.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,edd,Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Go! Go! Go!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,tormund,"Wun Wun, to the sea."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,jon snow,Let's go now! Now!
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,end,EPISODE
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You're good at that. Where did you learn?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,And good at putting holes in them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,And that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Bianca.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Mmm.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I can't.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"Why not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Come with us. What's left for you here?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Who?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,She doesn't have a name.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Where will you go?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,I don't know.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"The edge of the world, maybe."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I'd like to see that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,What's that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,Milk of the poppy.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,I don't want any.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lady crane,"Sleep is the only way you'll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,"Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,Course we do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"This is for masters, this technique. You're not ready."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,I'm ready.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,He says he's ready.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,All right.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,So fucking close!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,"Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,"Look at him. You get hard, boy?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,young man,"Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Fuck you!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,gatins,Cunt!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"You're shit at dying, you know that?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,red priestess,"From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'd call that a successful gambit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,Would you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Look around. The city has come back to life.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,You made a pact with fanatics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I did and it worked.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I'm going to miss you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I know.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Most of all, we need our queen."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,varys,I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The most famous dwarf in the world.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,The king is aware of their presence?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,"He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Your Grace, this is not a request."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Get out.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,"Move aside, ser."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lancel,Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,I choose violence.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"Looks like a siege, my lady."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,My lady. My lady.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,man,Who goes there? State your business!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,Not yet.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Are they in there?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,Mm-hmm.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You think they're fucking?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,What? No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,I'm her squire.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,You must have shown it to her by now.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,She's training me to fight.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Is she? Oh.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,"Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,Show me your stance.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bronn,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Why would you assume that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I don't think you know many girls like her.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I've come for the Blackfish.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You're welcome to have him.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,The Tully army.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Exactly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,We shouldn't argue about politics.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,What do you propose?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,He's even more stubborn than you are.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,You have my word. You have until nightfall.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,It's yours. It will always be yours.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Of course it does.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,To fight you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I've said no three times already.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Double the guards tonight.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,bryndel,The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"As I have said, my name is- -"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,He always spoke highly of you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,He's not my friend.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,No?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,She's exactly like her mother.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,You have more than she does.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,podrick,What should I write?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Tell her I failed.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,There's to be a royal announcement?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,There is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,Why wasn't I informed?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,Where are you going?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,To stand by my son.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,kevan,Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen lannister,"Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tommen lannister,"Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,crowd,Seven blessings.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,cersei lannister,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,qyburn,More. Much more.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,You seem happy.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Now it's like a man reborn.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I will be happy when our queen returns.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Unsullied never drink.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Rules.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And who made these rules? Your former masters?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And you? What's your excuse?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,That's how you know it's working.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Long may she reign.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Do you like it?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,Tastes like it has turned.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I do not know any jokes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Grey worm?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,It's funnier in Westeros.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,"The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,I do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Tell a joke.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,Two translators are on a sinking ship.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,"The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,Ah!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,You don't even know what a joke is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,You lied to us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,I make joke.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,More jokes.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,The Masters have come for their property.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Lord Edmure.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,I have your word?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Yeah. She should have killed you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Oh. Oh, I see. You're a madman."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Don't talk about Cat!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,I'll talk about whomever I want.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Who goes there?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,"Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Don't let him in.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"He's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,You're not obeying Edmure's commands. You're obeying the fucking Kinglsayer's commands.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,I demand entry.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,My lord has given an order.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Lower the drawbridge!
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"Aye, ser!"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,black walder,"If you're wrong, we're just surrendered our most valuable prisoner."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,"Welcome home, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,My lord- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Your lord has given a command.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,edmure,Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard captain,Find him.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,Go on.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Come with us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brienne,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,"Go on, now."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,brynden,I haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"We found the Blackfish, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaime lannister,Good. Bring him to me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,guard,"He died fighting, my lord."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. I admit it.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,missandei,That changes nothing.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,"All right, what should the army do?"
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,"We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,tyrion lannister,And then?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,grey worm,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,Clegane.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,What the fuck you doing here?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Chasing them. You?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,Hanging them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Any particular reason?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,You've got friends?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Not anymore. They're mine.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,It's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,You can have one of them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Two.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"No, no, no."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,We're not butchers. We hang them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,They die.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,We all bloody die.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Except this one here. I'll only gut one of them.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,No.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I'll chop off one hand.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Bunch of nancies.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"You're getting old, Clegane."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,He's not.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,lem,Please don't. I'll give you anything.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Got anything to eat?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,Enjoying yourself?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I prefer chicken.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,You ought to join us. We could use you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,thoros,"Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,Cold winds are rising in the North.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,And you're going to go stop them?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,We need good men to help us.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,sandor,"I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,beric,"Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,Lady Crane?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,"If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,Instead…
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,waif,Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,You told her to kill me.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen hghar,Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,jaqen hghar,Finally a girl is no one.
2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,arya stark,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
