2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"You've seen better days, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,"What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Robb? He's just a boy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Have my horse saddled and ready.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l agree. l'll go.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,everyone,You can't!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Unless there was a profit in it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stevron frey,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,ryger rivers,"Father, please –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,ls there somewhere we can talk?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"He is quite ill, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"My lord, l –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure there were reasons –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Why should l let him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You swore an oath to my father.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Why don't you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,voices outside,And engage!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Soon, he says."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,This is Valyrian steel.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,unidentified nights watchers,Well done. Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,"You earned that, Snow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Go on, let's have a look."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,At what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,The sword! Show us the sword.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,all,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,Let's have a look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Piss off.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Look at its eyes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What is it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l - l can't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You can't what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l'm really not supposed to say.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What? What about him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l should be there. l should be with him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Well? What did he say?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Huh.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,What does he want in return?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"Fine, fine. And?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,She won't be happy about that. And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l did.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,One was – Do you consent?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Can l refuse?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Not if you want to cross.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Then l consent.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam told you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,My horse…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cohollo,Blood of my blood…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,"No, l must ride."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Shagga likes axes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,They do seem rather ferocious.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l took her.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Took her? From whom?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,He said something.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Who would you like me to be?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Shae. What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What sort of accent is that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Foreign.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,For-
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What do you want from me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,And what do l get?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who told you this? Women you paid?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Let's start with your last night in this world.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l won't leave him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,The wound has festered.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You did this, witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,l think you're right.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,You've saved me once more.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,And now you must save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Do it. Save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a price.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My death?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Kill her and you kill your khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,Go. Now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Take her and leave. Take her!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,No one will enter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring him back to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have to save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This must not be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,This must be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Witch.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,Nothing good will come of this.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"No, you can't."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,irri,Khaleesi!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"No further, horselord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Are you hurt?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,The baby –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Hmm?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,is coming.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Fetch the midwives.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Just used to it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Let's play a new game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Not if you win.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What are you good at?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,This sounds like a boring game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play this game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,But my mother hit harder.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What brought you up there?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Work.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Are you sure –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,My turn.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who were you in love with?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,That's not how the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't care the way the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Married?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did you hear that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Not another night. This night.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Oh, maybe l will cry."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You should have known she was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You are still young and stupid.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What is it? What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're sleeping through the war.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Get my squire!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You don't have a squire.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You'll be dead. How will you know?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'll know.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Watch out! Move!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Out of the way! Move aside!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Stay low.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Stay low?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tribesmen of vale,Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,To battle!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're a shit warrior.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'm alive?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're alive.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Did we win?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Yeah, good."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,You're wounded.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,He wasn't here.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where was he?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And where are they?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,"We should go, my lady."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,No!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,My lady!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark bannermen,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's more use to us alive than dead.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Take him away and put him in irons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"Come on, pretty man."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Three coppers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,How about a nice fat pigeon?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,"Oh, piss off now. Go on."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Piss off!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Who?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,The Hand of the King.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Coward!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,Baelor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Traitor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grand maester pycelle,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,joffrey lannister,"My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sansa stark,"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cersei lannister,"My son, this is madness."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Put him down!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,yoren,Don't look!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Let me go.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,yoren,Shut your mouth. Look at me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sansa stark,"Stop him, stop!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,That's it. The tide's against us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,You're coming home.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Gods be good.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,But not over them?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Are you afraid, my lion?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I won't let them hurt you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,It is now.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Your words are always wise and measured.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You brought me something?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I know what ten drops will bring.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,"Your Grace, if I may ask-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,Yes. A siege is very-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,pycelle,Your Grace.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,To the boys!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Drunk Lannisters.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,You've got a pretty voice.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Thank you very much.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,Oh.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,prostitute,Poor nose.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I don't think he likes me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,You think you're a hard man?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I know it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Only smaller.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,And quicker. Eh?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Aye I expect he will someday.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Here we are.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,A wedding.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Do you trust him?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oddly enough, I do."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Good.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,The map you asked for.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm not."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,What of it?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't believe you have."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,They're welcoming the new king.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,Drums!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,The ships are in the bay.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,They must be far enough in-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Don't get killed.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Nor you, my friend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Oh, are we friends now?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,"Enhances it, really."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,bronn,Been spending time with fancy folks.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Shae.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Sansa.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Sansa, come here."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Will you?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Just as I pray for the king's.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Stay safe, my lady."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"And you, my lion."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Will you slay him yourself?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Some of those boys will never come back.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Shh. Come, my lady."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Where's our fleet?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,On the way.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,The king has asked you a question.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Where are their ships?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Maybe.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I doubt it.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Maybe she's jealous of you.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Why would she be jealous?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Sansa.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Yes.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What's he doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,But we have guards to defend us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,gold cloak,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You said he was here to protect us.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There they are.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Archers to their marks.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,"Archers, to your marks!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Archers! Nock your arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Nock arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Hold fast.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Hold fast!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Boulders ready!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,matthos,There's only one ship.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Nock and set!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Draw! Hold.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Hold.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,There's no one on board.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,More rocks coming up!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,davos,Matthos! Get down!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Prepare to land.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Your Grace.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,The dwarf has played his little trick.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,The wildfire.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,He can only play it once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,"We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Thousands.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Come with me and take this city!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,My queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Praying.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Oh. On all of us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even me?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Of course, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Even Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Joffrey is my-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,One for her.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Here. Sit. Drink.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,And if the city should fall?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Rain fire on them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Archers!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,There are too many.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"Pull, pull! Go!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,soldier,Nock! Draw!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Draw! Draw!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Kill the Lannisters!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Loose! Loose!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Form the line!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,"First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You were Robert's queen.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Pretty.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,When did you leave Lorath?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"Shae, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Tell us a story, Shae."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,"When I was thireen, I-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Your Grace!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What news?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is Joffrey?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back inside at once.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Your Grace-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,What?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,The king's presence is good for morale.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Bring him back to his chambers now.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Not here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"No, but I-"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Now!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Help me!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Fall back! Fall back!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,Get the ladders up!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Someone bring me a drink.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Eat shit, dwarf."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Clear!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Forward!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Forward ladders!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave! Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What would you have me do?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,joffrey lannister,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"She did not say, Your Grace."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,All men to the battlements!

2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Stand fast!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"No! Get up, you fool."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,We need more arrows!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Who are we fighting for?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Who leads us?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Yes.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,What are you talking about?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave! Heave! Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,"The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Where is my son?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,I want to escort him back to the battle.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,lancel,Now listen to me-
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,all,"Save our sons from war, we pray."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Come with me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,I need to say goodbye to someone.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,No one is raping me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,shae,Go. Run.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,The lady is starting to panic.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What are you doing here?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Not here for long. I'm going.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,Where?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,What about the king?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,He can die just fine on his own.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sansa stark,You won't hurt me.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,sandor clegane,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Heave!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,"Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,Attack!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,men,Roll it over!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,all,Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tyrion lannister,"Oh, fuck me."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,They're still fighting.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,The Kingswood?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,Like what?
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Like stags.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tommen lannister,Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,And wolves.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,podrick,My lord.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,"I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,man,Back to the boats!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,"Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,stannis baratheon,No!
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,cersei lannister,Father.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,tywin lannister,The battle is over. We have won.
2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,male singer,"And who are you,"" the proud lord said / ""That I must bow so low?"" / ""Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours"" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Are you sure about this?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,It's dangerous.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Why are you telling me?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,We have enough men?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,If Walder Frey cooperates.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,merry,I'm Merry.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Very good.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Still can't see you. Old eyes.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Thank you, my lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,Where?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,There.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Your men but not you?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,grey worm,I trust him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,You leave tonight.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,Very good. We'll prepare.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,barristan,Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,"We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,How do you know all that?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,I read about it in a very old book.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,Yes.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,You're like a wizard.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,gilly,Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Need a hand?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Need about eight hands.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,pig farmer,Many thanks.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't! Don't kill him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Dead rats don't squeak.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,More than anyone you know.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That so?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That him?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Good.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where are we?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Wildlings.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,That's what Old Nan said.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,There's a storm coming.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I don't see any.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,It's as good a place to shelter as any.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Only one old man and eight good horses.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,What's one old man doing with eight horses?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,He breeds them for the Watch.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,How's he keep folks from stealing them?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch protects him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,"Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,And proper steel.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Let's carve him up.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I keep telling you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,Ygritte!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Clear the barn!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Best part of the animal.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Don't worry, they're still there."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I know they're still there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,That give you some ideas?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Might do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,arya stark,Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,How did you get past it?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Some climb straight up the ice.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,Hodor!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,"Well, we'll have to open them up again."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,There's a rider out there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Just one?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,There's more.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"It's just thunder, sweet giant."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,hodor,Hodor.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,I yield. I yield.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Wildlings.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Hunting.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Make him shut up. If they hear us…
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"To Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, calm down."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You need to keep quiet.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,They're gonna hear us.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, be quiet."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Hodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,What did you do?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Nothing. I don't know.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,What's That?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,That's a horse dying.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,Bring them over here.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,wildling,That was the last of them. The rest are dead.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I heard shouting up there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Thunder.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Maybe it's ghosts.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"That won't help you, grandpa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Where you riding?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,"Doesn't matter now, does it?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"No, it doesn't matter now."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,You understand.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,Let me stand at least.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,Let me go with a bit of dignity.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,The wolves are out there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,I can't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,"You just did, with him."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,A wolf is nothing compared to that.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,old man,She looks sharp.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,Do it. Do it.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,Told ya. He's still one of them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,"Go on, boy."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Go on!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,orell,He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Kill him!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,He's one of them!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,ygritte,No!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,Do you hear me?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,tormund,You're not gonna die for one of them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Do it. They'll find us if you don't.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jon snow,You were right the whole time.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"When you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,Daario Naharis.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,That one was quick.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,There may be others.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,That's what you call a few guards?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roslin,"Lord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure,"You're a delight to me, my lady."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,septon,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure roslin,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,meera,Is that safe?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,They're long gone.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,They can't do that north of the Wall?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jojen,No one can do that. Anywhere.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Where?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,He'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Listen to me, little lord."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Don't worry, I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,Me? I'm coming with you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Right now, I have to protect you."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,"Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,We're not Southerners.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,And I don't want to leave you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Shhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You don't have to do any of this.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,rickon,I know how to swing a sword.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,bran stark,You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,I learned to walk in darkness.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,"Say your good-byes, little man."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,osha,Keep this one safe. He means the world to me.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,jorah mormont,It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daenerys targaryen,And Daario Naharis?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,daario,"The city is yours, my queen."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"They're good, aren't they?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,lothar,They ought to be because they cost enough.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,Look at the crowd there.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,The Godo s love to reward a fool.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Uncle.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,"What? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,I hope she makes you very happy.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,"Well, she's made me very rich."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,blackfish,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Striking your king is an act of treason.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"No, don't. Don't insult them."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,Your Grace.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,everybody,To bed! To bed! To bed!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,edmure,"Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again ."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Poor girl.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,That is a very strange custom.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,It seems normal to you?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Boy or girl?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,"I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,talisa,Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,I do.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,Where are you going?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,Got salt pork for the feast.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,The feast is over.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,It doesn't sound like it's over.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,"If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,"Got pig's feet, too ."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey guard,Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,Robb!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,man,"You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,man,"Feast over yet, is it?"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,frey man,"Aye, it's over!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sandor clegane,It's too late.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"The King in the North arises, heh heh."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,"You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,And why I would let him do that?
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,catelyn stark,"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,walder,I'll find another.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,robb stark,Mother.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,roose,The Lannisters send their regards.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,What was she like?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,She...she had red hair.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Oh? How big were her feet?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Well what do you want me to say?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,So you and Gilly never-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"No, you're really not."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,There will.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Yes.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,We could be waiting here a while.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,I probably killed him already.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,So you've said.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,Maybe I have.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Let me help you.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Maester Faull
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I don't love her.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes you do.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,No.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,You were?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Who was she?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,aemon,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Pyp! Open the gate.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I can't.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Sam, is that you?!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Yes!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I've never heard you curse before.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,It was horrible.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Never.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,I know there's no women allowed.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Get ready!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,thenn warg,It's time.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,Pick up the pace!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,A hundred thousand you say?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Yes sir.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,You can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,You're leaving me again?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I'm not leaving you!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,What are you going to do out there?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Help my brothers.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,gilly,Promise me you won't die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,I promise you I won't die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,pyp,But you're afraid now?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,styr,How high are the walls?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,nights watch,No!

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,alliser,"With me now! Now, with me!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We can't just let them attack the gate!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,janos,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,"Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Because I've made that claim.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ed,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,What are you doing up here?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,donnel,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,grenn,We hold the gate!

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,We'll go back there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,This is how a man ends.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,tormund,I shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."

2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I'm going to try.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,What are you doing?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,jon snow,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam,Jon. Come back.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Horses?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,We're not returning to Castle Black.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,Open the gates.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,It was a failure.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,It wasn't.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,"I went to save them, I failed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam,"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,alliser,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Your Grace, you've named me your Hand."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Yes.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,My family stays with me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,What's this one now?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,The Dance of Dragons
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Well that sounds like a proper story.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,And burnt him to a crisp.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Do you like it?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,He's beautiful.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Thank you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,You're very welcome.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,Of course I will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,But why am I getting a present?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,davos,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,You'll just have to read it yourself.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Doran.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Princess Myrcella.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,Uncle.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,What a lovely dress.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,You don't like it?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You must be cold.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,A fleabite.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,What are you doing in Dorne?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,myrcella,That necklace was stolen from my room.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I'm afraid he does.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I accept.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,The word of a Kingslayer.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,You're a good man.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,trystane,On one condition.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,"Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,You're going to miss.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,I never miss.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,Luck.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,Now it's my turn.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,You're too slow. You've always been too slow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,areo,You'll find out very soon.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,The most beautiful woman in the world.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyene,And that's the truth!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,nymeria,Slut.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Only the one.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,bronn,I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,There was one condition.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,Perhaps some soup instead?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,How much for your little clam?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,thin man,Come on.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,thin man,"Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm afraid I don't partake.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,banker,I don't have that gift.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,mace,"It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,"It wasn't bad, though."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,You're buying?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,"Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,brothel keeper,Sell your fish somewhere else.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,prostitute,"Oh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,prostitute,They say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,Three coppers.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jon snow,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Too old.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head prostitute,Brea.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,"I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Do you have what I want or not?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Of course. Of course.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,I'll have one.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,Good.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,I'll tell you when we're done.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,meryn,You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,Of course.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,head,"I'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,man,Valaar morghulis.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,And?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,Perhaps that's why the man is thin.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,arya stark,Tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,Tomorrow.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaqen hghar,A girl has work to do.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,doran,I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,You write like a 7 year old.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,He didn't try to make you pay?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,She will.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"You love her very much, don't you?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jaime lannister,"Of course, she's my niece."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,I wasn't talking about her.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,ellaria,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Father. Aren't you cold?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,No. What are you reading?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,The Dance of Dragons.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,What's it about?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,That's just what they call it.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Doesn't make much sense.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,I think it's poetic.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"It's alright, father."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,You don't even know what I'm talking about.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Yes there is.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,Forgive me.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,Where's my father? I want to see my father.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,"If we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,I can't.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,stannis baratheon,There's no other way. She has King's blood.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,melisandre,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,shireen,"Mother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,selyse,No...
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Where have you been?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Just making sure everything's in order.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,"Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,"My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,quick,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,strong,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,They're waiting for you. Clap your hands.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,The smaller man it is.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,You don't approve?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,That is greatness?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,My father would have liked you.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,We ask again
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,At your command?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If need be.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,A Meereenese champion?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,How many people will die to make this happen?
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Someone else's reason.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,announcer,or a Westerosi Knight?!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,Your Grace--
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,Shut your mouth.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can end this.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,She cannot.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,You can!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,Protect your queen!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,hizdahr,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,tyrion lannister,Stay close!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,jorah mormont,This way!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daario,"The other side, follow me!"
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Drogon!
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,daenerys targaryen,Valahd..
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,end,EPISODE
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Perhaps we should take shelter.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,The city is on the rise?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,it proves that no one needs a Master.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Good. Shall we begin?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,Do we have a plan?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,This is entirely different.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,My reign has just begun.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey worm,You men have a choice
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,grey worm,"fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,missandei,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,Him. He should die.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,belicho,"Yes, him."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,razdal,"He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yezzan,Please.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You don't have to be here.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"Yes, I do."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,How do we know you have him?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Now, if you want to save —"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,stares blankly at JON SNOW.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,A pincer move.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Good.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We should all get some sleep.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, for what they're worth."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're right.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,He's overconfident.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You don't know him.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We can't give up on our brother.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Aye, that's good advice."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You think that's obvious?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,It's not enough!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,You think there's hope?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,You saw these demons?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,What?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Jon Snow's not a king.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, he's not."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,So what do you do all night?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Happy shitting.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I'm not a soldier.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Any advice?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,Don't lose.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I'll have to try.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,How do you know what he commands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Why?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,What kind of god would do something like that?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,melisandre,The one we've got.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,It was a long time ago.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,And he paid for them.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Not my claim. Hers.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And what's wrong with you?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,I'm not fit to rule.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,We can agree upon that at least.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,No more than Westeros.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,You and I have that in common.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Will their ships be enough?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,The Seven Kingdoms.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,All of them.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,theon greyjoy,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,And that's all?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,Reasonable.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tyrion lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,That's our way of life.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,daenerys targaryen,No more.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,yara greyjoy,No more.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Don't.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Run and fight!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Now.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,karstark,"Cavalry, charge!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Loose!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,Get word --
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,We may as well be taking shits back here.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,Follow!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"It's time, go."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,smalljon,Who owns the North?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,all,We do!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,smalljon,Show me!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,Hey!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,"Infantry, advance!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,davos,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Tormund!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Get him back!
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,tormund,"Fuck this, come on!"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Their army's gone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,man,Our army's gone.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,We have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?"
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,jon snow,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Where is he?
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now."
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,My hounds will never harm me.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,They're loyal beasts.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,sansa stark,They were. Now they're starving.
2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,ramsay bolton,Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
