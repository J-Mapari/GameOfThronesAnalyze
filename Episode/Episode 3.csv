2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,"Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jory cassel,"Yes, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,But you just stood there and watched.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lord Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Grand Maester.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,And you served another King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Without the King?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Can the treasury bear such expense?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,How could you let this happen?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,It's ugly.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,Do I have to marry her?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I don't want to.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How would you handle them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,A royal army?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,For me. I'm their King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I'm not asking.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm practicing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,Practicing for what?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Prince.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Arya, stop!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,The Hound killed your friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,You're an idiot.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Enough!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,What's happening here?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,You've barely eaten a thing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's all right. Go on.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,War was easier than daughters.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Go away!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Mine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's called Needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,laughs] That's the essence of it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,So was I! He is a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Winter is coming.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I don't hate her. Not really.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I can keep it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I hate your stories.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,What are you telling him now?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Maybe we do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Don't ever say that.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I'd rather be dead.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,My Lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Follow me, Lady Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lady Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I must admit I do not.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Yours?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,To whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,Next!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,A charming man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Good news or bad?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Both.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,My wife is in Winterfell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Is she?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,It's an improvement.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,What do you care about our faces?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,We have proof. We have the blade.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How could you be so stupid?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Calm down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Then what are you raving about?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And my husband?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Let me go.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Never.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I wish I could see the girls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's too dangerous.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Just for a moment.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Until we know who our enemies are...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if you find the proof?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,He still loves you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Does he?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Off with you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"Of course, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Who was it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,How'd you do it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,Lance through the heart.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,"It's empty, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What do you mean it's empty?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,There's no more wine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Your outlaw... Any last words?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,From whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Tell them all to stop.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Until I command them otherwise.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,No!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,You walk. [to Viserys]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,You're leaving?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,What kind of reports?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,The kind I don't want to believe.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,But I'm better than every...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,A bear's balls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,You're joking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,Call me what you like.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,I always do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Armor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,There are no rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,She does not want to eat horse.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,All of them brief?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,It's a boy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,khal drogo,How do you know?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,I know.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"Farewell, My Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Who are you?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's too heavy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,What if I drop it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm a girl.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,A needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,"Out, all of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wait outside.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Now!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Leave us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What did you do?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What business is that of yours?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,You know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Don't lose it again.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Gilly.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,You're leaving.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,I can't take it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,"You, you shouldn't give it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,hodor,Hodor.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,Every night it's the same.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,So she was lying? They don't exist?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Loras! Highgarden!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,Get him!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,crowd,Oh!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Yield! I yield.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Well fought. Approach.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Rise. Remove your helm.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,colen,"Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,You are most kind.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,Your Grace.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Gerard. How's your foot?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,"Better, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,They don't know their own size is all.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Good man.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Why?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What are you doing here?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You lying bitch.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I've always wanted a castle.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Be careful of their nets.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,What are our words? Our words?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,We do not sow.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You gave me away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I have no other family.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Keep your voice down.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Again, only temporary."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Scullion? What is a scullion?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Kitchen wench.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,A kitchen wench?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but-"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,I'm the weakness?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,How is being a weakness a compliment?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,"Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,He might.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Would you like that?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,No. I don't think so.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Come in.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Who are you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,What things?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You said to brush your-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Not now.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Your chamber pot is empty.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Clean the table.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Yes.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,For whom?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Lady Zuriff.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Lady Zuriff
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,She wasn't in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Do you want me to leave?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Just brush my hair.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Please.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Thank you, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Why, yes, of course, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Matrimony, huh? Yes."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Precisely.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Tell no one what?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Who better?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That must hurt.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What? What is it?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'll make it up to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And Margaery's a virgin?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,As is your right. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You look very beautiful.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,It's a lovely gown.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You certainly don't need it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Must be the wine.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Here, let me."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'm sorry.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I don't know what you're talking about.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,She'll be a hostage.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,A guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You cannot stop it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Get out! Get out!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,priest,"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I would.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,Kneel.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,"Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Find him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, you don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"No, I don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, please, please."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,I am your loyal servant.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,The eunuch has spies everywhere.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, no, no."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,timett,"There are no goats, halfman."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Well, make do."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't like his beard.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What? What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So you poisoned him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,No. Never.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Lannister, I always served Lannister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,For your trouble.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I can't sleep.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I don't like the taste.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Same as most men, I think."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"No, I'm not afraid."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,I can fight.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,"Come on, move, move!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,Robb knows I meant him no disr-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,I seized an opportunity.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,What value was the mill?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Is he there now? Of course not.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,No.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,How many men did you lose?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,"But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,edmure,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,We seem to be running short of patience here.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,robb stark,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,What news of Jaime?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"We are trying, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,pycelle,A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Master of Coin?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tywin lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,cersei lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,pycelle,"Hear, hear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,men,"He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,You were armed when we were taken.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,You were not beating me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,Would I?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,You think I care about my teeth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,What does it matter?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What am I?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"So I can walk away, then?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,thoros,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Better than anyone you've ever met.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,A cowardo s weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Why? So you can kiss him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,You remember the last time you were here?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sandor clegane,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,anguy,Watch your head. Off we go.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,driver,Walk up!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,I'm staying.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,You're what?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,Winterfell.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,You sure?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,I'm sure.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Well, I made you something."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,What is it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,It's a wolf.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,That's the tail?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,Yeah.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,"Well, be safe."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gendry baratheon,You don't burn your fingers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,hot pie,"Good-bye, Arry."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Up you go, little lady."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,arya stark,"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,catelyn stark,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brynden,You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,You're Robb Stark's wife.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,Hold still.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,Is it true what they say about him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,I don't know. What do they say about him?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,True.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,"True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,martyn,Martyn Lannister.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,talisa,"Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,Always the artists.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,It's only horses. No men.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ygritte,You said there was dead crows.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,orell,There was.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,How many men were here?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,About three hundred.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,And you know what those men are now?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jon snow,Do you think anyone got away?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tormund,"We're finally going to war, old friend?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tormund,We'll meet again.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,orell,How will we see your signal?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,mance,"Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sam,Ghost?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,What have we here? Frozen crows?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,We've come a long way.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,Smaller flock than you went north with.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,We can talk inside.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Oh, can we?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,They need some water.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,Tether it and I'll be inside.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,karl tanner,Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jeor,You are a godly man?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,craster,"Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,Here we are.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,"Sharpen these for me, would ya?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,I see the head. Push.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,woman,That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,gilly,What is it? What is it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Keep quiet.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,I can ride.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,You're sure?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,Come on back.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,How long will you be gone?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I don't know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You're abandoning me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Then serve me.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"When I return, you will understand."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,I cannot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,Why?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I want you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"Your fires burn low, my king."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,There is another way. A better way.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,Yes.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,stannis baratheon,I'm the one true king.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,melisandre,"You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,To whom?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Give me your water.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Here, drink."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,And what is she to do for soldiers?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,Three.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,They did not. I want to buy them all.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,She wants to buy them all.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,greizhen,"If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,The slut cannot pay for all of this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,The gold you have left is worth ten.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,The Dothraki you have with you-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,I will give her three for those.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,"So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I have dragons. I'll give you one.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,"You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,Three dragons.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,One.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,Two.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,They want the biggest one.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Done.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,kraznys,Done.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,barristan,Aegon Targaryen proved that.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a name?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"No, Your Grace. No family living."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,"All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,missandei,Valar morghulis.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Not for bastards.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ros,"That's all of them, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Thank you, my dear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Yes, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,You should have him knighted.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We don't. I did fuck her once.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,But we don't.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Keep a low profile.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Well, you are richer than I am."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Good point.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You think all reading is dull reading.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Podrick.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"No, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"Uh, my lord"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,marei,He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"My lord, I don't even"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Be back in time for my supper.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Pace yourself, lad."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,No.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's stealing it?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What's wrong with that?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,And what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Well, you have to."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,But what if I don't?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,The lado s practically skipping.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,"They wouldn't take it, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,What did you tell them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,I didn't tell them anything.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,What did you do to them?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,Lots of things.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,And they seemed to like these things?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Only they weren't paid.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,bronn,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,Is that what you're telling us?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,podrick,doesn't deny it.>/i>
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,"Sit down, Podrick."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,tyrion lannister,We're going to need details. Copious details.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,Ha! Ha!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,"You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,Take off his pants.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No, no, no!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,"No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,theon greyjoy,"No, please! No! No!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,soldier,You little bastard.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,"Come, my lord."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,ramsay bolton,You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,brienne,"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,You're only making it worse.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,Come on!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You know who she is, don't you?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,I'm gonna cut your throat!
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I know what they are.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Bring her back here.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Yes, my lord. Get up."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,Come on.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Come on, on your feet."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Unbesmirched.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Not defiled.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Fancy word for a fancy man.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I bet you did.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Aye, you have both."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Hard to argue with that.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,man,"Come on, men."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"I'm famished, actually."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Well, I do like partridge."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,On the stump.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,My father-
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,jaime lannister,Don't.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,Have you got something to say?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,locke,"Here, this should help you remember."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,end,CREDITS
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,You did this. You did this!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,We have to leave.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Take him! Take him!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Where is she?!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No one leaves the capital! No one!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Get in.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Where are we going?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Somewhere safe.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Lord Baelish?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,"10,000."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ser dontos,Wait!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,I didn't murder anyone.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,Why did you kill him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He saved me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,He was helping me because I saved his life.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sansa stark,We're all liars here.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,So am I the queen?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,What was it like?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,margaery tyrell,But I would have been the queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olenna tyrell,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,It means I'll become king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,A good king?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Holiness?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Justice.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,What about strength?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Wisdom.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Wisdom is what makes a good king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,A king needs a queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,Yes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,How are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tommen lannister,I'm all right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,septon,"Yes, my lord. All of you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't know what I saw.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,It's not right. It's not right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jaime lannister,I don't care.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,Don't.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,cersei lannister,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You think? You don't have a map?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"No, I don't have a map."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Maybe we should get one.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,How far is it to the Eyrie?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Far.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,And you're sure we're going the right way?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,On your way where?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Why Braavos?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I have friends there.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I doubt it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Seven blessings to you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,What do you want?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,What do I want? This is my land.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,He's never been the same.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Which house did he fight for?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,The Tullys of Riverrun.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Father!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,I'm so sorry.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,Really good.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Did you fight at the Twins?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Guest right don't mean much anymore.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,You got any ale?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,Afraid not.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,farmer hamlet,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Fair wages for fair work.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,What did you do?!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,Get your horse saddled.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You told me you weren't a thief.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I wasn't.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,He took us in. He fed us and you...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You don't know that.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,arya stark,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sandor clegane,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ranger,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"There he is, Sam the Slayer."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,janos slynt,Going to visit your wildling whore?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,She's not a whore.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,janos slynt,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,They all think I'm lying.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,About what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Killing the white Walker.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,A what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"Well, a wildling."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,My father hated that word.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Why do you worry about it?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"100 men, one woman."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,They've got other things to think about.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,That's the only thing they think about.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You're being silly.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,What about you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Thank you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,For what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,For worrying about me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,So what are you saying?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Are you bored of me?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Your Grace.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Joffrey?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,What progress have you made?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Peasebury.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,House Musgood.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Musgood.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,And House Haigh.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,The Golden Company?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,They've never broken a contract.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,They're sellswords.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,We don't have any gold.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Not yet.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,stannis baratheon,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You're late.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"I'm sorry, Princess."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,I thought you weren't coming.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,"You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Thank you very much.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,What's the difference?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,My father says a criminal is a criminal.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You've sailed to Braavos?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,What was that for?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I need you to write a message.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,shireen,But that's not you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,davos,I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Precious little thing.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,What's his name?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Sam.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Lovely. That the daddy?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,No.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Where's the daddy?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,He's dead.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,Oh. Where you from?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,North of here.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town whore,North of here? You a fucking wildling?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,Only room and board?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,"Could find other work for her, too."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,No other work.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,moles town madam,There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,You protected me north of the Wall.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,gilly,Best for you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Greedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,No?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Your loss.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Does that surprise you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,Everyone has a preference.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"What are you, 25?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,Children.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olyvar,Did you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,They will all have to line up behind you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Lord Tywin.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,May we have the room?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ellaria,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Would you like to sit?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"No, thank you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some wine?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I'm sorry about your grandson.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Are you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Which way is that?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Some believe the king choked.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I did. This is why I know.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You think we conspired together?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,What did you discuss?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,The death of my sister.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,For which you blame me.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,Categorically.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I could arrange for this meeting.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,But you want something in return.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,Why?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,oberyn martell,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tywin lannister,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,A noble effort.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Your father.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Mace Tyrell.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"My lord, she's gone."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Gone?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,They'll be following you now.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,Who will?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Why not?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I'll ask, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Are you going to accept their offer?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,My lord.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"You've been good to me, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,podrick,"Farewell, my lord."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,tyrion lannister,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Mother says it's time to eat.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,guymon,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Potatoes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,guymon,"Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,man,The wildlings!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,ollys mother,Guymon! Hide. Hide!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,styr,You know how to get to Castle Black?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,olly,Yes. Yes.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,styr,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,yarwyck,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,men,Aye! Aye!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,yarwyck,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,men,Aye!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,maester aemon,We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,There's got to be a way to protect them.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorne,We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,Rangers returning.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,Help him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,What took you so long?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grenn,We were held up.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,By what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grenn,Chains.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,And the mutineers stayed?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,dolorous edd,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,We need to ride north and kill them all.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,alliser thorn,"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jon snow,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,pyp,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Are they attacking?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,What is he doing?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,I believe he means to...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,missandei,"He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,grey worm,"Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,barristan selmy,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Which is why you must remain by my side.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,jorah mormont,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,"I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,missandei,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,You sure you don't want a horse?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,Why would I want a horse?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Horses are faster than men.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daario,Horses are dumber than men.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,daenerys targaryen,Fire!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Valar morghulis.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,Valar dohaeris.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,Good.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"No? Why come, then?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I want to serve. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Where are they taking him?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,bystanders,Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Did I hurt you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,No. You were lovely.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,It all happened so fast.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Yes. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,So strange… Husband.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Do you like to sail?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,I love to sail.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I do, too."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"Well, but I'm a man now."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,I suppose.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,"I want you to be happy, mother."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tommen lannister,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Mother! . Welcome.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,You are very sweet.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,I'll leave you to it then. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,There's no need for such formalities.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Won't that be a lovely day.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,margaery tyrell,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Remember. Anything you need.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,He left you no choice.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,That's Moat Cailin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,No.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He did.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,He serves the Lannisters.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,For now.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,I won't go.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Winterfell is your home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Not anymore.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,No!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Sansa -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,How do we get through there?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,We don't. We go around. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,He hates that nickname.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,He borrowed it?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,As punishment. For both of you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Yes.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,I suppose that's more important.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,I was.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,He was.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But how did you end up serving Renly?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,podrick,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Lord Commander.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Your Grace.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I'd like to speak alone.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Say the word and you will be.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I can imagine no higher praise.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Are you bored of us already?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And the wildlings?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,stannis baratheon,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,As long as he's ruling them.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olly,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olly,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,And what needs to be done?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,davos,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What do you want?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,Who are you?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,No one.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,Ow! Cunt!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,"I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,You're about to find out.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,What are you doing?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,We were only playing. The game of faces.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,A girl is not ready.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,waif,Clearly not.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,I am ready.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jaqen hghar,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,arya stark,What do we do with them after we wash them?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Open gates!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"Lady Sansa, welcome."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Lord Bolton.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sansa stark,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,"Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Sam. . Maester Aemon?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,Greyguard is a ruin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Are you refusing to obey my order?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,Take Lord Janos outside.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"Olly, bring me my sword."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jon snow,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,janos,"I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,"You have served us well, my son."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Thank you, Father."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,The Maiden.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,Where is the Maiden?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,And the Stranger.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,"Two is extra, you realize?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Yes, yes."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,olyvar,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lancel,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,I am the High Septon of the -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,lancel,You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Repent!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Shame on you!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Sinner! Sinner!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,It doesn't matter. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You were assaulted?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,mace,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,pycelle,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,septon,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,meryn,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Seven blessings.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,Just a little more...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,Thank you ever so for the soup!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,woman,Seven blessings to you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Why no shoes?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,Perhaps they're right.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sparrow,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,Your Grace.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"At once, Your Grace. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,How's your work coming along?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,Very well.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,You've made progress?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,cersei lannister,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,qyburn,"Shh. Easy, friend."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,ramsay bolton,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. ."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He seems pleased.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,Shouldn't he be?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,The Queen will be enraged.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,roose,I'd like to read the reply.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Volantis is a large city.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,It's a perfectly good face.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I'm losing my mind.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Slaves.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,Lord cast your light upon us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,Lord cast your light upon us.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,We should keep moving.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,crowd,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,I was once as you are now.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,"Bought and sold, , scourged and branded..."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,priestess,He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Thank you.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Curious... hair. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,The mother of dragons!
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,What makes you worth that much?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,blonde prostitute,I'm magic. .
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,man,I bet you bloody are.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Well, , she's taken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,varys,Where're you going?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I need to speak to someone with hair.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Hello?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,Hello.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,You've got no drink.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,You've got no money.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,That's because they've never met a queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,You're just saying that.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,Why?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,Because you have a skeptical mind.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,"Alright, then. I'm warning you. We're gonna have to wash you first."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,Come on.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,Of course you can. You're shy.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,I'm not.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,black haired prostitute,Have another drink.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,"No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,tyrion lannister,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,jorah mormont,I'm taking you to the Queen.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,end,EPISODE

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,davos,The lady brought you back.
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,melisandre,"Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,Nothing There was nothing at all
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,melisandre,"The Lord let you come back for a reason Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be"

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,"I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed"

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"Yes Yes, I'm fine"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,I don't think so
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,"Sea, see They're spelled different, but they sound the same"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"Yeah, they do"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,"It was before I learned how to read, obviously"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,"Sam, are you going to be sick?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,Won't be long We'll be in the south soon I'm excited to see Oldtown Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros Are you going to vomit again?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"No No, no, no The Citadel doesn't admit women There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,I stayed at Castle Black There's no women allowed there
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,The Citadel isn't Castle Black I don't have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,"I'll stay in Oldtown, then"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,By yourself? With a baby and no money?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,gilly,"So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?"

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bran stark,But Father beat him

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,We know who you are I remember you eating the stallion's heart Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,"You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn't I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You're young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,daenerys targaryen,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dothraki matron,"Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I don't know how you stand it in all that leather
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,If we could have the room
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,woman,"If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,I am not a torturer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though it so often is what people deserve
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,"Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,vala,"If I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,That's good That's very good
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Who said this?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,Games are for children
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"There, that's a start"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Only the girls
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,We do not drink
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Until you do
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you took your time"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,You found out?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,"We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,You may be right
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,grey worm,So we will fight them?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,Possibly
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,missandei,Possibly?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,It's a conversation
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,varys,"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,Better

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,No one's seen him
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,And no one will That worked out rather nicely
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,little bird,Will Lord Varys ever come back?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,I don't think so Do you miss him?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,little bird,He was nice
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arthur,He called us his little birds He gave us sweets
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,It's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,Run along now

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,"Oh, a number of things"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,qyburn,He understands well enough
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Not yet
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He's arrogant, dangerous You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,Can I help you

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,lady olenna,Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because you're not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,maester pycelle,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaime lannister,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,cersei lannister,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,kevan,"No, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"Oh, your Grace"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace That's not possible Not yet"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,When will it be possible?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,When she's fully atoned for her sins
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,You've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I am the king
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,You are
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,And what does that mean to you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,Yes
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It's a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,Of course
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,It's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,Please
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,"If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,tommen lannister,My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sparrow,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There's so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Who are you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,No one
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Who were you before you came here
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,Arya Stark
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Tell me about Arya Stark's family
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,"Her father was Eddard Stark Her mother was Catelyn Stark She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers"

2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,"Rob, Bran, Rickon And a half-brother, Jon"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,And where are they now?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,They may be dead for all a girl knows
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Tell me about The Hound
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,Also dead
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,Arya Stark left him to die He was on her list
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,He was not on her list anymore She'd taken him off it
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,She did and she did not
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,She sounds confused
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,"Yes, she was"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,"Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,That's a short list That can't be everyone you want to kill
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,waif,Are you sure you're not forgetting someone
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,Which name would you like a girl to speak?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaqen hghar,"If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,arya stark,A girl has no name
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaqen hghar,Come
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaqen hghar,"If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jaqen hghar,Who are you?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,The Umbers are a famously loyal house
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,lord karstark,Famously loyal to the Starks
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"And you, Lord Karstark Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they? But here we are Times change"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,"When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,Your father was a cunt
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,"My beloved father, the Warden --"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him I might've done the same to my father, if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,My father was poisoned by our enemies
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,Mmm
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,"Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall We're farther north than any of you fuckers Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,So now you've come seeking help?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"We need to help each other The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam Won't take them long to get here"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,lord karstark,You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe He knows this place better than we ever will"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,Pledge your banners to House Bolton Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,I'm not kissing your fucking hand
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,I'm not doing that either
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,Your father honored tradition Knelt for Robb Stark Called him King of the North Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths I've got a gift for you
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,"A girl, I hope I prefer redheads"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"A girl, aye A wild one"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,I like them wild
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,"And the boy, nice and young The way Karstark likes them"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,Who's this?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,smalljon,Rickon Stark
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,How do I know that's Rickon Stark?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,ramsay bolton,"Welcome home, Lord Stark"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dolorous edd,It's time
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,"If you have any last words, now is the time"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,bowen marsh,You shouldn't be alive It's not right
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,Neither was killing me
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,othell yarwick,My mother's still living at White Harbor Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,alliser throne,"I had a choice, Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Night's Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,"I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,alliser throne,"I fought, I lost Now I rest But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dolorous edd,We should burn the bodies
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,You should
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,dolorous edd,What do you want me to do with this?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,jon snow,My watch is ended
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The bastard of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Davos Seaworth.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,and DAVOS shake hands.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Unluckily for me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Of course.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"Please, this way."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,I was born on the Island of Naarth.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,This place has changed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Does she miss me terribly?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I didn't ask --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,She's starting to let on.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,True. But I'm not a Stark.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Why?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,So where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,Volantis.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"I will return, dear spider. One last time."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,My Lady --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,melisandre,"I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,This is Jon Snow.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,He's King in the North.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Forgive me --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Forever.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Then why are you here?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,They're hard to miss.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"But still, I need your help?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Almost.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You told me you liked this man.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,The dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Is that another figure of speech?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The Army of the Dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,we're finished.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,davos,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,And why would I do that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Am I your prisoner?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,All of them?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,Your sister's dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon greyjoy,Euron has her.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,You saw him take her? And you got away?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,theon greyjoy,I couldn't save her. I tried.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,captain,You wouldn't be here if you tried.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Oh no!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,What a twat.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,I give you --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,A bit more than a true friend.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,There's only one reward I want.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,when the war is won.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Advice?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,euron greyjoy,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyene,Momma!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,The Long Farewell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's the one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,How long does the poison take?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,But death is certain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,qyburn,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,No.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,messenger,"At once, Your Grace."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"No, thank you."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tycho,Your father's daughter indeed.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,cersei lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You probably don't believe me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I do actually.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Good question.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,What do you mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Which wise man said this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,I don't remember.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Amazing thing to see.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,He is my Hand.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,He enjoys talking.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I don't.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I never expected that you would.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,I haven't either.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,Thank you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jon snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How much do we have?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What does that mean?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,wolkan,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"Very wise, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"No, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,yohn,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,So they should be.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I only meant to say --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,guard,"Lady Sansa, at the gate."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,"Hello, Sansa."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I wish Jon was here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,Yes. I need to speak to him.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I don't know what that means.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,It's difficult to explain.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"Try, please, for me."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,"It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,How do you know all of this?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,The three-eyed raven taught me.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I told you it's difficult to explain.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,Bran --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sansa stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,bran stark,I'll stay a bit longer.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Hmm.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Hmm. Does it hurt?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,A bit. Less than before.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,The infection no longer appears to be active.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,And the climate.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,How bad is it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,I owe my life to her and you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jorah mormont,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I hope they do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,You treated him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Yes.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Who told you to treat him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,No one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I seem to remember you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,But you treated him anyway?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I read the books and followed the instructions.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,"Thank you, Archmaester."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,Come here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,marwyn,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,daenerys targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,missandei,And what will they face?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,They will be ready.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,man,Draw! Loose!
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,tyrion lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,unsullied,There are none left.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey worm,There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,grey worm,Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It's done?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,It is.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Widow's Wail.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,"Yes, it has."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,I think we're done here.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,How will it happen?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,Will there be pain?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,jaime lannister,No. I made sure of that.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,That's good.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,olenna tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
