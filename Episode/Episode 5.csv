2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'd never worn this armor before.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who determines the draw?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Yes. That will never happen.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Robert tends to do what he wants.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lancel lannister,"It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're too fat for your armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lancel lannister,"No, Your Grace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're torturing the poor boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The breastplate stretcher?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long before he figures it out?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Maybe you should have one invented.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And who's going to hit you back?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'm not thirsty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Robert?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Hey.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,I can't watch.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'll take that bet.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Or you could even buy a friend.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,He's going to die.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Ser Loras rides well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I owe you my life, Ser."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sandor clegane,I'm no Ser.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Remove his hood.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,marillion,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,I did... often and loudly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,And why would I do that?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Five years ago.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,The dagger found
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,Should I gag him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"My Lady, this way."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Rodrik?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Bran...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow""."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Lords?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,The Greyjoys.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,And failed rebellions.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Good.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Words - ""Ours is the fury"". Lords - the Baratheons."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Hmm...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."""
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Lords - the Lannisters.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,We're still on their words.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,I don't know them.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,You do know them. Think.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,That's House Martell.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Righteous in wrath""."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,House Hornwood.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Family, duty, honor""."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,You know it is.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Family comes first?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,And then she left!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Why did she leave?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Do you know where she is now? Today?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"No, I don't."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,I'll never shoot another arrow.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,And where is that written?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,You need legs to work a bow.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Really?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Important enough for the likes of you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Might surprise you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Hmm?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You are jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,And what about the Starks?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You're a very serious boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Then get yourself a wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,But his mind is sound?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So they say.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I didn't trust you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So why do you trust me now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What sort of doom does the King face?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who gave it to him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Someone who could afford it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He started asking questions.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,This Hand is not the other.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,It never was.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You do move quietly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,We all have our qualities.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Strictly speaking.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Eyes I own.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,One shudders at the thought.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Oh.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Have you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Was that you under the bed?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, please."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To a small council meeting?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,Off with you. No begging.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I want to see my father.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,They said they were going to kill you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who did?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Oh, Arya."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Where did you hear this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What were you doing in the dungeons?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Chasing a cat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Your name, friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm a girl!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Did Benjen send you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Know what?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Best said in private, my Lord."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Go on. We'll talk more later.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,How many guards does my father have?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Well?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,To whom do I speak?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,There was no time to send word.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,My sister will decide what he looks like.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,I like you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I need to see the King first -- alone.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Is it about my wife?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,The whore is pregnant.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're speaking of murdering a child.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Based on whose information?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,grand maester pycelle,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,We should have had them both killed years ago.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,She dies.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will have no part in it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What can I do for you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Why? What do you care?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I don't have the time.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Heward and Wyl.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Find them and meet me at the stables.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,It is.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,He's little.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You're jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Are you sure this won't hurt?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Only if I slip.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,And you prefer me like this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Mhmm.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I want you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hold still.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Everywhere?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I have an outrageous amount of money.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,But a lot more than you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Do you know who should be King?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Be serious.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'm fourth in line.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Stannis?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,He's still my older brother.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,What are you doing?!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Look at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,You cut me!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,We still outnumber them.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Five.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What do you want?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Our marriage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Every day.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long can hate hold a thing together?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,So why now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I know.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,How many?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jory!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,My Lord.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Such a small pack of wolves.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I remember him well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,If you threaten my Lord again...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,You swear it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And the wording of this oath?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And in return for my son's loyalty?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,No! No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,Follow me!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,You'll die for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Inside the king's tent - go
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I won't leave him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Over there, go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,Not that way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,We need to go home. Loras.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"My lord, my lady."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Get out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,And you want that privilege for yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,There's no time for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't stay here.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Revenge.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,He was very handsome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,No. I want to be the queen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Killed? By whom?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It's wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,I'm telling you the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,She's making wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,When did she tell you this?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Swear to me on what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,On my life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But I don't care about your life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,It will be my pleasure.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What is it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,When do we sail for King's Landing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,That's not your concern.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What do you believe?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,girl,I've got it! I've got it!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,Corruption.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,crowd,Yes!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,He's talking about you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,What? Demon monkey?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,You don't need to convince me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Demon monkey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Yeah, come on."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"Where are we headed, Captain?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Stop. We yield.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Congratulations on your first command.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Come on, I'll take you out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Dagmer, your first mate."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,You're not.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,My wife's in Lannisport.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Maidenpool, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"House Mooton, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what is their sigil?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They call him the Young Wolf.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And do you believe them?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,Fetch that water.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A girl says nothing.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I was always a girl.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I didn't have a choice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,You did. I did. And here we are.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Three what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man has said.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,The one who tortures everyone.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man needs a name.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,When will he come?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Most of them are true.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,Wildlings?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,Well I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Take care, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My companion takes issue.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,To do what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,How much do you have?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"My lord, this man is insulting."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,This is a shit idea.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys. Dracarys.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He loves you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my friend."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,It is known.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,May he ride forever through the night lands.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,It sounds wonderful.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Please excuse me for a moment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What are they doing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Or melt it. Very simple.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,"Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Not even when we leave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Why not?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What is the House of the Undying?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,You watch over her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Do I know you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It looked like Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,In the shape of Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I never knew my mother.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm sorry.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It's a bloody business.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,What comes after is even harder.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You mean to kill Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I swore a vow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I only held him that once as he was dying.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Good.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,Hodor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,hodor,Hodor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,We have to help them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,"Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Do you need so many?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,rodrik,"Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"So, what does it mean?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"Must not mean anything, then."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You're lying.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You know what it means.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,I never said I didn't.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,You didn't give me an honest answer.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,That's not the same as being a liar.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Well, it's not far off."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,"Something bad? Tell me, boy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,I know. It's just a stupid dream.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,osha,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,There.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Where?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,On that mountain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,I don't see very well.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,A fire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,How many wildlings have joined him?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,Where?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,We need to get rid of those lookouts.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,He's the one?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,qhorin,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And what about what a woman wants?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"Ah, a conqueror."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,I will show you why.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And behind the door?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And it can all be mine?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,All I have to do?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,Is marry me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,That was a romantic proposal.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The usurper is dead.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,I only want-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What do you want? Tell me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,To see you on the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,And how do I get the ship?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,I look forward to meeting him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You should stand sideface.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Sideface?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Sideways.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Why?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Smaller target.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gendry baratheon,Am I fighting someone?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Go up the battlement.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,That is strange.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,gold cloak,Move away. Stand back. He's dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon us."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,"Lord of Light, defend us."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Get back.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,men,Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Kill him!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"Arya, don't!"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Bring him back from death and darkness
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,No! Let go of me! Let me go!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Burn in hell!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,He will. But not today.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,How often do these patrols go out?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,You'd like to know that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Three.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,You sure of that?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Which three?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Castle Black.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,How many men remain in Castle Black?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Liar.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,He's no crow.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,orell,Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not afraid of you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,"I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,A thousand men.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tormund,We'll find out soon enough.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't need you to protect me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Give it back.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Ygritte.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,All of me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,We shouldn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,We should.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,Hmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,You seemed to like it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,There's been no one else. Only you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,A maid. You were a maid.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,What do you think?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,Who was he?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jon snow,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,I'm not done with you yet.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,How long's it been since you had a bath?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,ygritte,"Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,I want my gold.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,anguy,We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sandor clegane,"Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Not in the eyes of god.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You can't!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,Riders coming through!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,The Kingslayer.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,Down!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,"Pick him up, Locke."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You've lost a hand.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,"No, my lord, he has it here."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Take this away.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,locke,Send it to his father?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,"Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,"Thank you, my lord."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Is there word from the capital?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,roose bolton,Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Will I die?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Mmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,"With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,No milk of the poppy.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,There will be pain.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,qyburn,Quite a bit of pain.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'll scream loudly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I shall do my best.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I assure you that it will.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,podrick,"Pardon, my lady."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Naturally.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I understand that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,Good.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I would.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,My lady-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Quite sufficient. Thank you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olenna tyrell,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Give me that.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,What are you doing?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Why?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You don't have to do this.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,I want to. They need good men.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,"He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I can be your family.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,gendry baratheon,You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,Willem. Willem!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,willem,Is this a rescue?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Lannister filth! Take him!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,martyn,"Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Bring them in.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,They were boys! Look at them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Leave him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,man,"Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn stark,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,catelyn stark,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,edmure,"A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,"The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Kneel, my lord."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,rickard karstark,Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Don't think of it that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,But it is that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It is. And it isn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,More is than isn't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,So why don't you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,We need the gold.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"Do I frighten you, child?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I thought he killed you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,He did.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,But how?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,How many times?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"Five, I think. No, this makes six."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Six.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Then I was stabbed in the belly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,And the Hound makes six.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,thoros,"I don't think it works that way, child."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,beric,"He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,arya stark,I would. You're alive.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,My lady.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I meant to come sooner. The battle-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"Yes, of course."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I believed that once.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You're doing godo s work.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,"Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,That's not true.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,selyse,You are a king. You don't need my permission.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Shireen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Father!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,You've grown since I last saw you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,He did. He fought bravely.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,"He won't be visiting, child."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Why not? He's my friend. Look.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,stannis baratheon,Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,What are you doing here?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Now get out.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,There's another tub.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Why should I care how you die?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Don't you mock me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,You need trust to have a truce.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,I trust you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Of course.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,brienne,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jaime lannister,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Shh, you'll wake Bert."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Bert?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Aye. So they did.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,Take it. I have more.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,"My lady, I can't read the words."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,You can't?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,No. No. No.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,It's easy. It'll be fun.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,Go. We can't.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,davos,I wouldn't know where to start.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,It was a bitch of a siege.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You swore an oath.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,With all my heart.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,These are the ones?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,Remove your helmet
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,This one has the honor.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,What is your name?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,Grey Worm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,Grey Worm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,missandei,"All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,daenerys targaryen,"From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,grey worm,"Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,King Robert wanted her dead.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,I didn't sit on the small council.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,Mm-hmm.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,Which men do you have in mind?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,barristan,"If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,jorah mormont,You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Come to bed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,You were right.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Don't let him.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Give them a new purpose.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,What?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,"Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,What is it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,talisa,Can you do it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,robb stark,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,margaery tyrell,And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,Squire!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Well fought, ser."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,That was no fight. I don't know you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Olyver, if it please you."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,How did you know?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,Know what?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,That I wanted to.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,"My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"They rarely do, in my experience."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,loras,"You have a good deal of experience, do you?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,With the husbands.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,That didn't take long.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,olyvar,"Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,What is?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Is it?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Many ladies wear it this way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,You still want me to come with you?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,"I do, Lord Baelish."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Petyr.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,sansa stark,Petyr.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,We'll speak again when I return.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're late.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,What's she doing here?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Your jokes are not appreciated.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't my best, but-"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And how do we do that?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Wonderful.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Yes, it is."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,You can't mean it.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,I can and I do.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,She's a child!
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,And if I refuse?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tyrion lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Only too well.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You'll marry Ser Loras.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,I will not.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"No, I won't do it."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,cersei lannister,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,tywin lannister,Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,shireen,"It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay."

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He sits the throne like he was born to it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"No, he wasn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You still mourn for Joffrey?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He was my husband. My king.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He would have been your nightmare.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I feel..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,He has you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,"Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,margaery tyrell,I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Who told you to take the Navy?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,No one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,So why did you do it?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daario,I heard you liked ships.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many ships?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"Ninety-three, Your Grace."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How many men can they carry?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,The Lannisters have more.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,"They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,barristan,The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jorah mormont,"What, then?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,daenerys targaryen,I will do what queens do. I will rule.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,But how would they know?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Stand to.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,Stand to!
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,knight,"Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Uncle Petyr!
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lord.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Oh. I have brought you a gift.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Lord Baelish.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lady.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,My flesh and blood.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Of course. I understand.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,I would never say a thing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"They did, and my father's."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,"They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Make him fly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,robin,Through the Moon Door.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No. We never...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Go. We'll speak soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,What took you so long?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Let's get married tonight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,I do think that we could wait until...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Like it was yesterday.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Tonight it is, then."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A fortnight?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That seems reasonable.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,And your wedding to Loras?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Shortly?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,A fortnight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,We had that in common.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then whom can we trust?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Ourselves alone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Haven't a clue.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"Go on, your best guess."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,That can't be.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,How much?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,A tremendous amount.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,tywin lannister,"I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Would you shut up?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,I can't sleep until I say the names.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,"If he were here right now, what would you do?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,I'm almost done. Only one name left.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Go on.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,The Hound.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Thank you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Really?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Yes. I'm very lucky.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,He feels responsible for you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Loved your mother.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,No.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,That's what you wanted to say.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"No, never."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Are you pregnant?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,"Your young, pretty body."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,Nothing. I'm a virgin.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Don't lie to me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,You're hurting me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,I'll know if you lie.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sansa stark,"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,lysa,Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,That's a long way off.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"All knights have squires, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"I swore an oath, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I know.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What do you think will happen if you leave?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,The hell you doing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Practicing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"What, ways to die?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,No one's going to kill me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,What do you know about anything?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,It was not.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Was? He dead?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Yes.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,How?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,He was killed.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Who by?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,He was outnumbered.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,arya stark,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,sandor clegane,Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Your Grace.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"A poem, actually."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,May I show you the gardens?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"No, you couldn't."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I didn't realize you were a poet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Not a very good one.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,For your paramour?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,For one of my daughters.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"You have several, don't you?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Eight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Eight? Eight daughters?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Beautiful name.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Which joke is that?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We can avenge them.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Yes, we can avenge them."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I know he did.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,"The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,Anything at all.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,oberyn martell,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,cersei lannister,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"Oh, no, no, no."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, no, no, no."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,Hells. Gods.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Did you remove the skin?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, my lady."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,"No, my lady. That was the cooks."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What are you doing?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I'm helping you with your armor.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I killed a man.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Who?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,How did you kill a Kingsguard?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,podrick,I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,brienne,Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,rast,"Hey. Hey, get up. Get up."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,"That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,Aye. What we need is a girl there.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,I've got to have a piss.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,Now keep quiet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,You need water.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,It doesn't matter.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,Of course it matters.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,You mustn't let anything stop you.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,They already have stopped me.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,No. You're not here. You're far from here.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,What does that mean?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,"You've seen it, too."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,"Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,We will.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,meera,How... will we know the end?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,You'll know.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Brothers.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,dolorous edd,You do move quiet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,How many?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,Not yet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Why?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,locke,"They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,New moon tonight.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,Get her up.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,bran stark,Stop.

You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jojen,"If you let my sister go, I can help you."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,karl tanner,You can help me?

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,doloroud edd,Five.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,What the seven hells could do that to a man?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,I count ten dead mutineers.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,grenn,Locke said there were eleven of them.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,dolrous edd,Where's Rast?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,man,Here's another.

2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,dolorous edd,What should we do with this lot?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,morag,"Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,jon snow,You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,morag,Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daario,"We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,But... I'm the leader of my family.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Walk forward.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,You cannot do this.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Another step.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,But she does not give up on them.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,All men must die.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Maester Aemon.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,Lord Commander.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,How are you feeling?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,But you don't know what it is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,aemon,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What about you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,What if I unchained you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Why would you do that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,And now everything is going to change?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It is.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Why now?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,We'll need ships.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tormund,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,"You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,What?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Nothing.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,allister,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,And we've slaughtered theirs.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,edd,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,It's not a trick.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,olly,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,podrick,She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Aye.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Did you know Lord Eddard?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Everyone knows. The Boltons.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Who are you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Swore to who?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,Her mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,man,Her mother's dead.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,brienne,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come back here. Myranda.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I saw you staring at her.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,You said you'd marry me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Do you think she's pretty?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Never.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,"Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,"Oh, I don't need-"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,"You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,But who -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,woman,You're not alone.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I like your dress. Who made it for you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I made it myself.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Really?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,"Who, who are you?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,My mother. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Thank you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I'd rather have a mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,Down there at the end.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,What is it?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,myranda,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Theon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,You shouldn't be here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Do you have something to tell me?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Reek.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,She saw me.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Who?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,She saw you?

2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Come here.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Give me your hand.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,I forgive you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."

2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,To your wedding.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,"Yes, master."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"That's his new name, Reek."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,Why are you doing this?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Sorry about what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,theon greyjoy,For killing your brothers.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"Yes, yes, very good."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Wonderful. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,walda,We're going to have a baby.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sansa stark,I'm very happy for you.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,How can you be sure?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Sure of what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,So how did you manage it?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,Manage what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Getting her pregnant.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,And if it's a boy?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,You're worried about your position.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,You've never asked me about your mother.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,roose,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,ramsay bolton,Yes.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Is this every book there is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,Every book there is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,In the world.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Where's that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,I'm sorry I don't know things.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,Well -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,It's where they train the maesters.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,gilly,Like Maester Aemon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"Ah, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,You're Samwell Tarly?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I am, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I did, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,How?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Dragonglass?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,What the maesters call obsidian -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,Seen what?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam,The army of the dead. And when they come -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,It's time.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"No need, they're coming with us."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"As you wish, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,Beg your pardon?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,Is there going to be a battle?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,selyse,"That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Yes, my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,I'm not scared.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,davos,"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,shireen,I promise.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,stannis baratheon,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jon snow,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,You're still too weak. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,How long have I been here?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,Three days.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,Ser Barristan?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,All men fear death.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,grey worm,"No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,missandei,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"My, my queen, please do not do this."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,hizdahr,"Yes, my queen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,daenerys targaryen,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,We are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No wine.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I am.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Have you sailed this route before?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I think you'll be plenty.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,No. But the pirates are.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Oh.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,And then they weren't.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,I would clap.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,What was that?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Get behind!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Mormont! Mormont!
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,I suppose that's why they send them there.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,Without luck?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,jorah mormont,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,tyrion lannister,That's the best idea you've had all day.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Yes?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"For you, my lady."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,How far is Mole's Town?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Unharmed? What are you doing here?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I can't begin to contemplate --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,What do you think he did to me?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,He beat you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,What else?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Did he cut you?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I didn't know.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I'm so sorry.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You said you would protect me.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,What if I want you to die here and now?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Then I will die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I have an army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Your brother's army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Half-brother.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,waif,You're not ready. You should go home before it's too late.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,waif,"You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,She has a point.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,Who was the first?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,"He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,Where did they go?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,"Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,A girl has no desires.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,Who?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,"An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,Ahh!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,"Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,"Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don't die."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,"Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,ladyc rane,"I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"Ooh! Ooh, what's happened here, then?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you're the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"I'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,"I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,The Iron Throne's what I demand.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,You cannot.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,I can.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,You will not.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,I will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,You dare not.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,I dare yes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,The line of succession.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,What's that mean?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,The proper progression.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,The lawful ascension.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"So move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,But we had a deal all done and dusted.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,Save my father.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,"Save him, please."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,"Good people, you may all relax. My father's friend shall be spared the —"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,"Father! No! Oh, father."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you'll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life. And he's give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,You'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,clarenzo,It's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,camello,"Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,"You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,I had two lines.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,izembaro,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,I rang very false?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bianca,You weren't complaining about me last night.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,"I'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,Of course we're going to be intimate.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,It's only a matter of time.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,To our children.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bobono,May they have your talent.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,lady crane,And your filthy mind.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A girl is not ready.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,She's a good actress.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,So a man has heard.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,Seems like a decent woman.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,No. Who wants her dead?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,That does not matter. The price was paid.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,arya stark,A girl has decided.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jaqen hghar,A servant does not ask questions.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,No! No! No!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,It was you. You made the White Walkers.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,From whom?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,From you. From men.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,We've never had a queen. Not once.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,Aye!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,We are a sea people.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,Our god is a sea god.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,You shall not be queen!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I am not finished!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon's own male heir has returned."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,"And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is a reaver!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is a warrior!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,She is ironborn!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I'm Euron Greyjoy.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I claim the Salt Throne.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Niece.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Nephew. Little Theon.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,"When did you return, Uncle?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,"That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,theon greyjoy,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,And how will she do that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,"Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,yara greyjoy,You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aerson,Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,"What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,What is dead may never die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,all,What is dead may never die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,aeron,They stole our best ships.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Won't be enough to save them.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,euron greyjoy,Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,You must send me away.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,Is there a cure?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,How long does it take?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jorah mormont,"Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,"Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,None.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,"Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,grey worm,For now.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,For now is the best we get in our profession.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,It's not enough.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,missandei,The people know who brought them freedom.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Who said anything about “him”?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Welcome to Meereen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,She did indeed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,I'd settle for obeyed.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,That sounds most excellent --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,varys,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,tyrion lannister,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,kinvara,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,What?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,"He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,He touched you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,"I don't know. He was close, but --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,He knows you are here. He'll come for you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,But he can't get in.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,"He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,The time has come.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,The time for what?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,For you to become me.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,bran stark,But am I ready?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,No.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"Precious little, my lady."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"No, but I do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,How do you know that?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,davos,"That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"I've sworn to protect you, my lady."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,What is it?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,I don't like leaving you here alone.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,With Jon?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,brienne,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,New dress?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I made it myself. Do you like it?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,"Good, because I made this for you."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,"Thank you, Sansa."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,sansa stark,You're welcome.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,jon snow,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,I'll do my best.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,Good luck.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,man,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,I'm not the Lord Comman --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,dolorous edd,"Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn't a cave."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Eat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Get Bran and run!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Help me!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,rickard,Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young ned,"Yes, Father."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,rickard,"But if you have to fight, win."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran! Bran, wake up!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, we're all going to die!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up! We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Warg into Hodor now!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,"Listen to your friend, Brandon."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Summer!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Go. Go!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,threeeyed raven,The time has come. Leave me.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,What are you doing?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,leaf,Go!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,"Hodor, hurry!"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,meera,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,,Wylis! What's the matter?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,young hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You could have killed me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,What the fuck were you doing back there?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Ending the war by killing her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You saw the dragon between you and her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,looks incredulously at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,You're fucked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't you mean we're fucked?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I have to tell Cersei.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,pauses and looks at JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,Best well jump back in that river.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Step forward, My Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not kneel?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,I already have a queen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,"There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,You will have to kill me too.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,Step back and shut your mouth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,randyll,A stupid boy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,dickon,I will not.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm not beheading anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Your Grace --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,drogon,draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,My Lord.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,How many men did we lose?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We haven't done a full counting.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,turns and walks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,He didn't.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,After all this time it still amazes me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,After.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,And you believed her?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"looks away, then sits down."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You weren't gone long.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns back to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and doesn't say anything.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You're not sure how you feel about that?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"No, I'm not."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Thousands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,So it was a figure of speech?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,He is my friend.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,kneels before DAENERYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Your Grace.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,stands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I served with your father. He was a great man.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,nods to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You look strong. You found a cure?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,It would be my honor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,steps forward and hugs JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran stark,s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bran stark,Ravens. We need to send ravens.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,nods his head to BRAN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,archmaester,MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,stops working and turns around.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Brandon Stark --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,the crippled boy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,Do you know him?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,steps forward and clears his throat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Archmaester --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,"That will be all, Tarley."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,"It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I'm afraid so.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,maester,Horrible business.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,marwyn,Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys is not her father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Who is that for?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Jon Snow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Did you read it?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What's it say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Nothing good.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,interrupts VARYS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I need to go home.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,You said you don't have enough men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking around the table closer to JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,So bring the dead to her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Is that possible?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,And how would you get into King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,nods his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,varys,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,They won't have to.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,I haven't given you permission to leave.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,robett,"The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,yohn,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,These are mother and father's chambers.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,And?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Don't do that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns around to face ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,What?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Say what you mean.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,Are you angry with me?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Their opinions are important to you?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,Not if they lose their heads first.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,I have work to do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sansa stark,turns and walks away from ARYA.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,My lady.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,exits the room.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,You're not staying here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,What if someone takes the boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,And here I am ready to train.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why down here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,I'll leave you to it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,bronn,turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,remains silent and stares at TYRION.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Don't talk about our father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Listen to me --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,What do you want?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I thought you might still be rowing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Anybody give you any trouble?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,nods.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I think you need to understand --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I'm ready. Let's go.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You should know what you're heading into.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,You might want to bring one of those swords.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,this I know.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Who should I say I am?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,You there.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Is that your boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,It is.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,The docks are that way.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Still five gold dragons?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Are you joking?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,You must be even older than you look. 15.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,15?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Apiece.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,turns and begins walking back to his boat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,What's in the boat?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,pauses and turns back to the guards.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Not more gold.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Wine?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Mmm.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,I like wine.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Or hams.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Come and have a look.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Fermented crab.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,What?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,"Oi, Dwarf!"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,quickly walks to cut the guards off.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,That dwarf --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Where did you get that scar?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,guard,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,This is Gendry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,He'll do.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,That won't be necessary.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,Ser Jaime.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,qyburn,closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Why was QYBURN here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,I met with Tyrion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,What did our brother have to say?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,To discuss a surrender?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,To discuss an armistice.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Are you going to punish him?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Bronn.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,looks confused.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,You let it happen. Why?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,Who will you say is the father?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,You.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,People won't like that.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jaime lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,cersei lannister,Never betray me again.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I understand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You don't have to worry.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Understood.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You survived King's Landing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Yet again.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Your Grace, this is --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,steps forward in front of DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks to DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He was meant to keep that to himself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I met yours in my shop.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're a lot leaner.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,You're a lot shorter.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,I grew up on stories about them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Do you know how to use one?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,shakes his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"Well, that's a problem."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,I prefer a hammer.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,looks to DAVOS.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,He can handle himself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,nods.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We could use the help.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,"I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tyrion lannister,Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I --"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,smiles.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,But I've grown used to him.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,daenerys targaryen,nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Heave!
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,"15,782."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,looks away and pauses.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,None anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,"That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Steps. That number was steps.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam,"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gilly,Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,arya stark,"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"I found it, my Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,hands BAELISH a raven scroll.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"Yes, my Lord."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,wolkan,"turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents."

2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,"JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I've been failing at that job of late.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,How many queens are there now?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Two.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Both.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,How many men did you bring?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,looks around the table.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,Not enough.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,The big woman?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,We were hoping some of your men could help.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,nods his head.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You are.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,turns to look at JON.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You really want to go out there again?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You're not the only ones.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Thoros?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,sits up from a dark corner.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,I hardly recognized you.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,Ser Jorah Mormont --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,He was my father.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,He hunted us like animals.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,davos,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,beric,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sandor,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jorah mormont,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,thoros,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,He's right. We're all on the same side.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,gendry baratheon,How can we be?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,jon snow,We're all breathing.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,tormund,hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.

2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Come in.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,And?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Nothing?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,She won't eat.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We'll try again at supper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,I think they're watching me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Who?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,Her soldiers.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Of course they are. That's their job.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"What have I told you, Martha?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,martha,"The greater the risk, the greater the reward."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,The Northern armies?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She shouldn't be alone.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Aren't you worried for her?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,We both know what she's about to do.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,What do you want?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,I don't want it. I never have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,She is my queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,There's something you need to know.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Yes.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Varys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,He does.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,And Varys?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was a mistake.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She trusts me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,But it doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,It was me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,I love you. And you will always be my queen.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"All right, then."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Let it be fear.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I beg you, my queen-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,daenerys targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Let them pass.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Through the gate.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,guard,Get going.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She wants to attack now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jon snow,Daybreak at the earliest.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Careful with that.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,My lord.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,davos,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,He's always better when he's got some food in him.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Ay up. Where you going?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,I need to go talk to my captain.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,sandor clegane,"Go ahead, talk to him."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,soldier,Where's he going?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I want to see the ...
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,We speak the common tongue.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,We have orders to guard the prisoner.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,unsullied,No.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,How did they find you?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Did you consider taking it off?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You've underestimated her before.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Difficult to do from here.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Why?
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,Swear to me.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You have my word.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,I'll try.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,jaime lannister,You would have.
2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,tyrion lannister,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
