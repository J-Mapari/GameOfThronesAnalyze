2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,robb stark,"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,galbart glover,Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,greatjon umber,"My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,rickard karstark,l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!

Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,"l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,"Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,"But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,Because of men like you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,There are no men like me. Only me.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,l pushed him out the window.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,Why?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,I hoped the fall would kill him.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lancel lannister,"l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,cersei lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,They have my son.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,leo lefford,l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,addam marbrand,ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,l'm told we still have his sisters.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,leo lefford,The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,And do what?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jorah mormont,They say the child was –
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jorah mormont,"A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jorah mormont,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,This is not life. When will he be as he was?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Leave us.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Your life.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,He knew my name?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,shae,"I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,What thing?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,ros,"About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"Oh, you can do better than that."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.

Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Maybe he's a little squire.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Let's have a look.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,l could use me a sword like that.

Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"

So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I thought you said you knew who I was.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,ros,I'm afraid of him.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Walk.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,One or two tried.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Not interested.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,What are you doing?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Burying them.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I didn't leave it here.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I had me dagger.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Untie me. Now!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Traveling a prisoner.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,You're a woman. A woman!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"Well, fuck me!"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,If you've quite finished up-
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"All right, we'll be going."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,The Starks.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,What did he do?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"No, stealing is a crime."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Where are you taking him?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,To Riverrun.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Why Riverrun?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Why not kill him?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,For stealing a pig?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Sending him with you? How important could he be?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"All right, have it your way, my lady."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Do I know you?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Have you been to Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,No.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Then you don't know me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Is it near Ashemark?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I've never been there.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,What do you think of these beauties?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"Two of them we did, yeah."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,"I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,Two quick deaths.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaime lannister,Those were Stark men.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,brienne,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I know that.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,And you mean to do it anyway?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,I love her.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,I know that seems important to you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,It is important to me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,catelyn stark,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,robb stark,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,l I did. I still see it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You claimed to speak for a god.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,You talk about war as if you understand it.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,I've been fighting far longer than you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Have you? Show me how you fight.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Show me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Inside you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I murdered my brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,He wasn't your brother.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,Let me show you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,"Look into the fire, my king. Look."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,I see fire.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,melisandre,"Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,stannis baratheon,Yes.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,They want you to know you're surrounded.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,No word from my father?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,No.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,Send more ravens.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,You killed all the ravens.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,The first time I saw Winterfell-
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,men,Aye!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,You think they're right?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,black lorren,Aye.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,"We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,Mothers will name their sons for us.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,men,What is dead may never die!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,black lorren,Thought he'd never shut up.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,dagmer,It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,luwin,What is this? What are you doing?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,dagmer,Let's go home.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,man,Come on.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Why should I believe you?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,Why would I lie about it?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,To create strife between my sister and me.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,podrick,"No, my lord."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Then my hill tribesmen.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,varys,"Come along now, Podrick."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,My love.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,It was good of you to come.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,Good of me? Of course I come.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,I want to see you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,"Believe me, you don't."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,Have you looked?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,I will be the first.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,tyrion lannister,Well?
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,shae,You are a mess.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,jaqen hghar,"To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips.

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,arya stark,"I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too."

2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,drogo,Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,daenerys targaryen,That sounds like something you would do.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,drogo,"Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms."

2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,You should learn to ignore them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."

2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,I hear that you're a pervert.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.

2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sansa stark,That's the vulgar word for dung.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,My lady-

2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,"Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pycelle,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I am the king! I will punish you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come along.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I'm not tired.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,joffrey lannister,I'm not tired!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Come.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Not you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,You really think a crown gives you power?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,No. I think armies give you power.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,The Northerners will never forget.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I will not rape her.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,Does that amuse you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"Easy for me, is it?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tywin lannister,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Sansa.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,It's empty.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Let's find a place to sleep.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Don't, Hodor."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Maybe we shouldn't stay.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,You'd rather be out there?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,I always quite liked the horrible stories.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,So did I. Once.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,No. Who's he?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,The Blackfish escaped.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,As you say.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,You'll be needing a new young girl.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,Forever young.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,"Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,walder frey,Oh. And?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,roose bolton,Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,But my father taught me to aim for their head.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Kill me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"Sorry, what?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,A little louder.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Kill me!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You're no good to me dead. We need you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,"You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,Stinking meat.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What's your name?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Th- Theon Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Please.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ramsay bolton,What is your name?!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,theon greyjoy,Reek. My name is Reek.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Don't kill me!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Who are you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Sam! Sam!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Who are you?!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Gilly. Don't hurt us.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Where are you going?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"My brother, he's in the Night's-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Shush.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Who's your brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Doesn't matter.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"No, I'm not."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,hodor,Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Take us north of the Wall.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,What? Why in the world would you want to go-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,I don't want to. I have to.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,How did you get through the Wall?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,How do you know all that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,But you're going to stop them?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Theon disobeyed my orders.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,"The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,He's your son.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Son? He's not a man anymore.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,balon,Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,Get those ropes!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,yara greyjoy,I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,What is it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jojen,Dragonglass.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,Why? What are they for?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Killing White Walkers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,How do you know that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,meera,But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,"Take it, Hodor."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,bran stark,I wish I could. I really do.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,How are you keeping?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Great. Never better.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,It was just a bit of blood.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I'm not a highborn.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,She called you Ser. I heard it.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I lived below the Street of Flour.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Gin Alley.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,So how'd you become a lord?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Oh, that's a long story."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,"Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,You see? Highborns.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Why did you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Does he?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,He's dead.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,How'd he die?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Following me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,When did you come to this strange country?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,When I was thirteen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You were only a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"No, I expect not."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,I have a name.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,Why do you want me to leave?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,varys,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,Lord Varys.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shae,"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Keep up.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,podrick,"I don't think I can, my lord."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Leave.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,She doesn't deserve this.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,So she can have some happiness in her life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,You have children. How happy would you say you are?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,Even Joffrey?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,How long does it go on?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,tyrion lannister,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,cersei lannister,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"Aye, not for long."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,You sewed it on?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,I did.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,"It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,What do you want?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Mind if I keep warm?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Fuck off.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,But I'm hungry.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,I've got money.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,What kind of coin is that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,It's worth a lot.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Sorry.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Little shit.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,frey soldier,Fool!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,Where did you get the knife?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,From you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,Is that the first man you've killed?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,The first man.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sandor clegane,"Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,arya stark,Valar morghulis.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I do know some things. I know I love you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,I know how this must look. What I meant was-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,"I swear to you, my lord-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Gilly.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,"Yes, my-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Maester.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Master.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,And the child?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,His name is Sam.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gilly,Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,"Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,Miles better.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,maester aemon,We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Night.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,I don't know. There just is.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Well, your father's not going to go to that."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Noblemen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,What is it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,shireen,Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Stay here. Bar the door.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Aegon Targaryen.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Everything.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,The boy must die.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,What are you doing?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You're leaving.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Is this some kind of trick?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Yes, but not on you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,I know not to drink seawater.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Where should I go?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,The gold cloaks are looking for me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,No.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,The other way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,You ever been in a boat before?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,You know how to swim?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Don't fall out. Go on.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,gendry baratheon,Why are you doing this?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,guard,Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,pyp,I don't think he can see us.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jon snow,Pyp? Sam?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam,"Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,"Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jaime lannister,Cersei.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,You don't deny it?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,No. I let him go.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"Aye, I do."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,There has got to be another way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,Take him away.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,Why am I gonna need you?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,My king.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,When did you learn to read?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,"This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,davos,"You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,I've made my decision.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,melisandre,He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,stannis baratheon,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,barristan,"They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,jorah mormont,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,People learn to love their chains.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,missandei,"This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom"
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,No.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,"You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,man,Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daughter,Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,What does it mean?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,missandei,"It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Fly.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,daenerys targaryen,Let me pass
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You're wearing a black cloak again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Yes.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,And?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,She's dead.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Your doing?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,No.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We'll drink to her.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Ygritte.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Ygritte.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,That's not wine.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn came from a farm.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Mag and Grenn.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Grenn and Mag.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,Turn your army around and go home.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,You attacking us?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Hold! To me. To me.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,You're the king beyond the wall?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,You know who I am?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,Never had the pleasure.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,We do not kneel.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,mance,"All the same, we do not kneel."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Take these men away.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,davos,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Your father was an honorable man.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"He was, your grace."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,What do you think he'd have done with him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,stannis baratheon,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jon snow,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Bloody Martells.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"It is, yes, manticore."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Yes there is.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,May I ask what you think you're doing?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Saving him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,pycelle,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Not anymore.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,You can save him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Will it weaken him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,qyburn,Oh no.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Very well then.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm opening it again.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I will not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,No.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,And how will you do that?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I'll tell everyone the truth.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,And what truth would that be?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,Known what?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,"No, no, no, no, no."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Your legacy is a lie.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,tywin lannister,I don't believe you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes you do.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Jaime.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Tyrion is your family.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,He's not.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You don't get to choose.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I choose you.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Those are words.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Told him what?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I told him about us.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You told him?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,You think he'll just accept that?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,Go and ask him.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,What did you say?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,jaime lannister,Someone will walk in.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,cersei lannister,I don't care.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,"in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,You speak it very well.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,What is it that you want from me?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,fennesz,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,barristan,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,Approach my friend.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,man,"in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,man,"crying, speaking Low Valyrian*"
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,translating* My girl. My little girl.
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,What was her name?
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,missandei,"Zala, your grace."
2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,daenerys targaryen,How old was she?

2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,But… the Dragonglass?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,But… you killed a White Walker.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"Well, there's Edd."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,They'll bloody try.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Sam…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,Very carefully.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,I'll come back.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,To your return.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam,To my return.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,podrick,My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,How do you know it's Stannis?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,podrick,He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,soldier,"There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,Bolton has women fighting for him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,I did.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brienne,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,stannis baratheon,"Go on, do your duty."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,Looks like we're done here.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,survivor,I surrender. I surrender!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,And I accept your surrender.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ramsay bolton,Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,theon greyjoy,Go with her. Please.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sansa stark,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,"Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myranda,Stop! Stop!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,man,Open the gates!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,theon greyjoy,He's coming back.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,meryn,I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,I can't hear you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,Do you know who you are?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,You're no one. You're nothing.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,I was right about her.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,You were.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,You're not ready. Not at all.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,That man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,Only death can pay for life.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,"No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,Why are you crying?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,He was my friend.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,waif,No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,He was no one.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,But if you're… Who's this?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,The faces are for no one.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,You are still someone.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,And to someone…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaqen hghar,the faces are as good as poison.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,I can't see!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,arya stark,What's happening?! What's happening?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,doran,I wish you a safe journey home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,ellaria,Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,bronn,Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyene,Maybe I'll come visit you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,bronn,Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyene,"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"Whenever you're ready, My Lord."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Try not to lose it this time.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I'll never take it off again.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,Do you think mother will like him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,And you really believe that?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,She likes you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,No you don't.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I know what you're trying to say.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,No. I'm afraid you don't.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I do.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,myrcella,I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jaime lannister,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Does he always talk so much?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,Jorah the Andal.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Torgo Nudho.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,You should not be here.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"No, but he is."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Our queen would be dead if not for him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,It's true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,A bit “rusty”.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Rusty” Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,You missed a good scrap.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And I intend to help her do it.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,You betrayed her!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,Careful now.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,The second time thanks to you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Pardon me?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Can you fight?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,Are you good on a horse?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,Middling.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,So mainly you talk?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,And drink. I've survived so far.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jorah mormont,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,grey worm,I am.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,missandei,"It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daario,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,voice,"Hello, old friend."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,tyrion lannister,I did miss you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,varys,"Oh, I know."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,We have to go home.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,How far did you carry me?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,septa,Confess. Confess.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,You wish to make a confession?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Name him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Lancel Lannister.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Your cousin. And the King's squire.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I was lonely and afraid.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,You had a husband.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,His sins do not pardon your own.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,May the gods forgive me.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Other men?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,No.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,No others?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I do.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Trial? I have confessed?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Thank you. Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,Good.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,Am I free to go?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,After your atonement.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,cersei lannister,My atonement?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sparrow,"A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,septa,Shame. Shame. Shame.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,crowd,Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,woman,I've had half as many cocks as the queen!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,man,"Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,Your Grace. It's good to have you back. Come. We'll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,qyburn,"If it please Your Grace, he's taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace's enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,The wildlings will make a difference!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,It's not their fight!
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Stannis?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,davos,Shireen? The princess?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,olly,Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,olly,Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,He could be lying.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Could be. There are ways to find out.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,jon snow,Where is he?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,Over there.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,alliser,For the Watch.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,brother,For the Watch.

2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,attendant,Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,mistress,You got my money?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,Later. Go away.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,girl,Grand Maester.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,To which crimes will you be confessing?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,"I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,You understand fully what this means?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Brother Loras…
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,loras,I will.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,mace,"No, I can't let them…"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,"Faith is the way, Father."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tommen lannister,All right. I'm ready.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tommen lannister,"I have to go, I'm-- I'm late for the trial."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"I've kept my word. Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,And where is the queen mother?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,Get the others.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,Where's the king?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Elsewhere, I'm afraid."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,pycelle,What's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,"The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lancel,What are you doing?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,There's something wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sparrow,"If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,"Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,We all need to leave now!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Loras. Stay with me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,margaery tyrell,Let us through!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess. Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,septa unella,No.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Confess.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,You've always been quiet.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,septa unella,Good. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Shame.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,attendant,"I'm very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,For House Lannister!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,men,Hear me roar!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,For House Frey!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,men,We stand together!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,You're welcome to her.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Those two have their eyes on you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Not my type.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Not blonde enough?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,There you go.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Maybe I'm not in the mood.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,Fuck it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bronn,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,I'm sure he would be.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Edmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,I'm a bit old for all that.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"No, but back in your day."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,Show me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"Your Grace, there's no need--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,cersei lannister,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,Hello.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,Oh.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,"According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,He died.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,This is irregular.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,"The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,maester,No women or children!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,What is that?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,The Princess Shireen.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,We burned her at the stake.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,Why?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,You burned a little girl alive!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,I only do what my Lord commands!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,I didn't lie. I was wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,melisandre,"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,davos,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,I'm not a Stark.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,You are to me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,He did.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,And you trust him?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,Jon.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,obara,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,What is your name again? Barbaro?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,obara,Obara.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,nymeria,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,"Do shut up, dear."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Anything from you?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,You're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,olenna tyrell,And what is my heart's desire?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,ellaria,Vengeance. Justice.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,varys,Fire and blood.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not coming with us.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Who are you marrying this time?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I don't know. Maybe no one.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,A king wouldn't think twice about it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,The dwarf told you to do this.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No one tells me to do anything.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Don't get angry.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,Bay of Dragons?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,"You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daario,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what's coming for them.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,How did he take it?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,No tears.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's not.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, you really are."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,It's your counsel I need.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tyrion lannister,It's yours. Now and always.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,daenerys targaryen,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"You're not one of mine, are you?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"No, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Didn't think so. Too pretty.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"They're here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"But they're already here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,"Here, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,handmaiden,They weren't easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,walder,What…
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,arya stark,My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"Forgive me, my lady… if you're at prayer."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was a stupid girl.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,You were a child.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,What do you want?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,I thought you knew what I wanted.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,I was wrong.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"No, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,It's a pretty picture.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sansa stark,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,petyr,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,This is where I leave you.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,You're not coming with us?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,Where will you go?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can… as long as I can.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bran stark,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,benjen,I wish you both good fortune.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,meera,Are you sure you're ready for this?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,bran stark,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,Ned?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Lyanna.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,Is that you? Is that really you?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,You're not a dream.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,"No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"I've missed you, big brother."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,"I've missed you, too."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I want to be brave.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Shh. You are.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I'm not.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,I don't want to die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,You're not going to die.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Get her some water!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"No, no water."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,eddard stark,Is there a maester?
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Please. Listen to me, Ned."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"If Robert finds out, he'll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,vale knight,You can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,tormund,We didn't invade. We were invited.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,vale knight,Not by me.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,man,"The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,lyanna,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,manderly,"Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime. I didn't commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jon snow,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,glover,The King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,all,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,jaime lannister,Come on.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,qyburn,"I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms."
